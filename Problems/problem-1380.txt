Chef has found an integer array AA of length NN. He defines the beauty of an array as the maximal value of gcd(Al,Al+1,…,Ar)⋅(r−l+1)gcd(Al,Al+1,…,Ar)⋅(r−l+1) over all the subsegments [l,r][l,r] of the array AA.
Chef loves to explore, so aside from the beauty of the initial array, he wants to know the beauty of the array after performing each of QQ updates. Each update replaces a subsegment of the array with an arithmetic progression. Updates are cumulative.
Formally, in each update you are given four integers ll, rr, xx, and yy. Then for each i∈[l,r]i∈[l,r], you must replace AiAi with x+y(i−l)x+y(i−l).
Input Format

The first line contains an integer TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
The first line of each test case contains two integers NN and QQ - the length of the array and the number of updates.
The second line contains NN integers - the array AA.
The next QQ lines each contains four integers ll, rr, xx, yy - the description of an update: an arithmetic progression with the initial term xx and the common difference yy on the subsegment [l,r][l,r].

Output Format
For each test case, output Q+1Q+1 lines. In the first line for each test case output the beauty of the initial array, in the ii-th (2≤i≤Q+12≤i≤Q+1) line for each test case output the beauty of the array after performing i−1i−1 changes.

It is guaranteed that after each update, no element of AA is greater than 109109.
The sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 105105.
The sum of QQ over all test cases does not exceed 105105.

Explanation
After the first operation A=[2,6,4,12,18,12]A=[2,6,4,12,18,12]. The maximum value is reached on the segment [4,6][4,6].
After the second operation A=[2,2,6,10,14,12]A=[2,2,6,10,14,12]. The maximum value is reached on the segment [5,5][5,5].
