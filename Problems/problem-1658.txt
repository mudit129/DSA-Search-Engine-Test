Chef's planet is called Javad. A year on Javad has NN months numbered 11 through NN. For each valid ii, the ii-th month has aiai days numbered 11 through aiai. 
On Javad, years that are divisible by 44 are leap years - the last month of each leap year is one day longer (it has aN+1aN+1 days).
You are given Chef's birth date and the current date. Find the age of Chef in days, i.e. the number of days between Chef's birth date and the current date inclusive.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aNa1,a2,…,aN.
The third line contains three space-separated positive integers ybyb, mbmb and dbdb denoting the year, month and day of Chef's birth respectively.
The fourth line contains three space-separated positive integers ycyc, mcmc and dcdc denoting the current year, month and day respectively.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — Chef's age in days.
