You work as an engineer. You were given an empty board with KK consecutive cells; at any moment, each cell can display one character.
You want the board to display a string SS with length N>KN>K. Since the board isn't large enough, you want to display the string in N−K+1N−K+1 steps. In the ii-th step (1≤i≤N−K+11≤i≤N−K+1), you'll make the board display the characters Si,Si+1,…,Si+K−1Si,Si+1,…,Si+K−1.
The power required to switch the board from step ii to step i+1i+1 (for 1≤i≤N−K1≤i≤N−K) is equal to the number of characters displayed on the board that have to change between these steps. You should find the total power required for the whole process of displaying a string, i.e. the sum of powers required for switching between all consecutive pairs of steps.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.
The second line contains a single string SS with length NN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the total power required for text switching.

Explanation
Example case 1:

In step 11, the board is displaying "aab".
In step 22, the board is displaying "abb".
In step 33, the board is displaying "bbc".
In step 44, the board is displaying "bcc".

The power required for switching from the 11-st to the 22-nd step is 11, because cell 11 changes from 'a' to 'a' (requiring power 00), cell 22 changes from 'a' to 'b' (requiring power 11) and cell 33 changes from 'b' to 'b' (requiring power 00); 0+1+0=10+1+0=1.
The power required for switching between the 22-nd and 33-rd step is 22 and the power required for switching between the 33-rd and 44-th step is 11.
Therefore, the answer is 1+2+1=41+2+1=4.
