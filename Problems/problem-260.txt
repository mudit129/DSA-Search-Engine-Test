You are given a sequence of non-negative integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. At most once, you may choose a non-negative integer XX and for each valid ii, change AiAi to Ai⊕XAi⊕X (⊕⊕ denotes bitwise XOR).
Find the minimum possible value of the sum of all elements of the resulting sequence.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of the input contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum possible sum.

Explanation
Example case 1: If we choose X=6X=6, the sequence becomes (4,5,2,3,0)(4,5,2,3,0).
Example case 2: We can choose X=7X=7 to make all elements of the resulting sequence equal to 00.
Example case 3: We can choose X=1X=1. The sequence becomes (0,0,2)(0,0,2), with sum 22.
