You are given a set SS and QQ queries. Initially, SS is empty. In each query:

You are given a positive integer XX.
You should insert XX into SS.
For each y∈Sy∈S before this query such that y≠Xy≠X, you should also insert y⊕Xy⊕X into SS (⊕⊕ denotes the XOR operation).
Then, you should find two values EE and OO: the number of elements of SS with an even number of 11-s and with an odd number of 11-s in the binary representation, respectively.

Note that a set cannot have duplicate elements, so if you try to insert into SS an element that is already present in SS, then nothing happens.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer QQ.
Each of the next QQ lines contains a single integer XX describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing two space-separated integers EE and OO.

Explanation
Example case 1:

Initially, the set is empty: S={}S={}.
After the first query, S={4}S={4}, so there is only one element with an odd number of 11-s in the binary representation ("100").
After the second query, S={4,2,6}S={4,2,6}, there is one element with an even number of 11-s in the binary representation (66 is "110") and the other two elements have an odd number of 11-s.
After the third query, S={4,2,6,7,3,5,1}S={4,2,6,7,3,5,1}.
