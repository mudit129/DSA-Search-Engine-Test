Chef's fans want to celebrate the special occasion of his birthday, so they are writing letters to him. Chef has received NN such letters from NN fans (numbered 11 through NN). Initially, for each valid ii, he assigned a beauty BiBi to the letter from the ii-th fan (these values may even be negative, for letters that are not written well).
Now, Chef wants you to process QQ queries on these letters. There are two types of queries:

Q x y: Chef wants to choose integers ll and rr such that 1≤l≤x≤y≤r≤N1≤l≤x≤y≤r≤N and read all the letters from fans l,l+1,…,rl,l+1,…,r. Find the maximum possible value of the sum of beauties of the letters he reads.
U x v: Chef reevaluates the beauty of the letter from the xx-th fan. The new value of BxBx becomes vv.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN.
Each of the next QQ lines describes a query in the format described above.

Output
For each query of the first type, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum sum of beauties.
