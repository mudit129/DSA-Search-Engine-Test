You are given two sets of points SS and TT on the xyxy-plane. SS contains NN points and TT contains  MM points.
The points (xi,yi)(xi,yi) in TT have a special property - for every 1≤i<M1≤i<M, xi+1>xixi+1>xi and yi+1<yiyi+1<yi.
For each point (x,y)∈T(x,y)∈T, find the minimum Manhattan distance between (x,y)(x,y) and a point in SS. Formally, for each (x,y)∈T(x,y)∈T, find
min(xi,yi)∈S(|x−xi|+|y−yi|)min(xi,yi)∈S(|x−xi|+|y−yi|)
Input Format

The first line of input contains two space-separated integers NN and MM - the size of SS and TT, respectively.
The next NN lines each contain two space-separated integers xixi and yiyi, representing the points of SS.
The last MM lines each contain two space-separated integers xixi and yiyi, representing the points of TT.

Output Format

For each test case, output MM lines. The ii-th of these lines should contain a single integer, the minimum Manhattan distance between the ii-th point in TT and a point in set SS.

Explanation
The sets are S={(0,0),(1,1)}S={(0,0),(1,1)} and T={(0,1),(1,0)}T={(0,1),(1,0)}. Every point in SS is at a (Manhattan) distance of 11 from every point in TT.

Explanation
The sets are S={(2,2),(3,3),(3,1)}S={(2,2),(3,3),(3,1)} and T={(0,3),(3,1),(5,0)}T={(0,3),(3,1),(5,0)}. 

The point closest to (0,3)(0,3) is (3,3)(3,3), with distance 33
The point (3,1)(3,1) in SS coincides with the point (3,1)(3,1) in set TT.
The point closest to (5,0)(5,0) is (3,1)(3,1), with distance 33
The points in red are the points of the set SS and those in blue belong to set TT. The green-coloured line segments represent the Manhattan distance between two points.
