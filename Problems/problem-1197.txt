 
A Keyboard manufacturing company, built some faulty qwerty keyboards. As soon as they realized that some of the keyboards are faulty they tried to develop a software to correct them but their developers are noobs so they ask you to develop the software for them.
The issue with the keyboard is that the key placement is not appropriate. The keys of the right hand are faulty. 
 When the user press j it appears h.
 Similarly when you press h it appears as ;(semi-colon), y → p, b → .(full stop).
Input

Each of the next T lines contain a sentence S(containing only lower-case english alphabets and valid characters as described) printed by the faulty keyboard.

Output
For each test case print the correct sentence the user wants to type in a new line.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 105

 
Example
Input:
