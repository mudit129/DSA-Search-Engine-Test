Sanket already knows about his marks! So what's the fuzz about?

Sanket's Mom is very good! She has decided she will gift him a new mobile phone if he scores atleast K marks(sum of marks of some papers)!
And, she can give him mobile phone without knowing all the marks of papers too, provided that he scores atleast K marks(sum of marks in some papers)!
So, you know how many papers are there, what are his marks, and you have to tell if Sanket, will get his new phone or not?
