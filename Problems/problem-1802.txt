He makes a string MM of length N, such that after deleting a substring of non-zero length from M, the remaining string is S.
Calculate the number of all such possible strings he can form.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
For each testcase the there is a single line which contains an integer, N and then a string S.

Output:
For each testcase, output the number of possible strings modulo 109+7.
Constraints
