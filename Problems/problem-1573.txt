You are given two strings AA, BB made up of upper case and lower case letters.You have to check if they are same. Two strings are samesame if they satisfy both of the following conditions:

|A||A|=|B||B| 
AiAi=UpperCase(Bi)UpperCase(Bi) or AiAi=LowerCase(Bi)LowerCase(Bi) for every 1≤i≤|A|1≤i≤|A|

If any one of the above conditions is not satisfied then the strings are differentdifferent. 
Non-matching indices are those indices which violate the 2nd condition.
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
First line of each testcase contains string AA. 
Second line of each testcase contains string BB. 

Output:
For each testcase, if both strings are same then print samesame, otherwise print differentdifferent followed by the first non-matching index, on a separate line.
Constraints

1≤T≤1001≤T≤100
1≤|A|,|B|≤1051≤|A|,|B|≤105
AA and BB contain upper case and lower case letters only.

Subtasks

5 points : |A||A| = |B||B| and both strings contain lower case letters only.
10 points : AA and BB contain lower case letters only.
85 points : Original Constraints.

Sample Output:
same
different 4
different 4

EXPLANATION:

In first case both strings are samesame.
In second case the strings violate 1st condition so they are differentdifferent. First 3 indices satisfy 2nd condition but A4A4 = ′\0′′\0′ whereas B4B4 = ′P′′P′, therefore first non-matching index is 44.
In third case 1st condition is satisfied but 2nd condition is not satisfied. First non-matching index is 44 since A4A4= ′h′′h′ whereas B4B4 = ′i′′i′.
