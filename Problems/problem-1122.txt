Chef has NN markers. There is a cap on each marker. For each valid ii, the ii-th marker has colour aiai. Initially, for each valid ii, the colour of the cap on the ii-th marker is also aiai.
Chef wants to rearrange the caps in such a way that no marker has the same colour as its cap. (Obviously, each marker must have exactly one cap.) Can he do that? If he can, find one such way to rearrange the caps. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aNa1,a2,…,aN.

Output

For each test case:
If Chef cannot successfully rearrange the caps, print a single line containing the string "No" (without quotes).
Otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string "Yes" (without quotes). The second line should contain NN space-separated integers describing a valid rearrangement of caps. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these integers should denote the final colour of the cap on the ii-th marker.
