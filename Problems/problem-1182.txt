 
GANDEY and GHATAK play the following game. They choose a number N to play with.
 The rules are as follows :
1) GANDEY plays first, and the two players alternate.
2) In his turn, if N is a perfect square the player reduces N to square root of N and if N is not a perfect square he subtracts 1 from N . The number thus obtained is the new N.
3) The game ends when N reaches 1.
4) The person who finally reduces N to 1 wins the game.
Given N you have to predict who will win the game?

 
Input
The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines contains an integer N.
 
Output
Output T lines, one for each test case, containing "GANDEY" if GANDEY wins the game, or "GHATAK" (without quotes) otherwise.
 
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
2 ≤ N ≤ 10000
