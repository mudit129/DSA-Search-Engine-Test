Hussain really likes problems that involve summation over X, where X can be subsets, paths in a tree, intervals of numbers etc.
You are given two integer sequences A1,A2,A3,…,ANA1,A2,A3,…,AN and B1,B2,B3,…,BNB1,B2,B3,…,BN. Consider an arbitrary non-empty subset SS of the set {1,2,…,N}{1,2,…,N}. Let's define the swagness of such a set as
(max(p∈S)Ap)⋅(max(p∈S)Bp).(max(p∈S)Ap)⋅(max(p∈S)Bp).
Hussain is interested in the sum of swagnesses of all possible sets SS. (Note that there are 2N−12N−1 such sets.) Since the sum may be very large, compute it modulo 109+7109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,A3,…,ANA1,A2,A3,…,AN.
The third line contains NN space-separated integers B1,B2,B3,…,BNB1,B2,B3,…,BN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the total swagness modulo 109+7109+7.
