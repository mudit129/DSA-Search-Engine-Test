Chef is interested to solve series problems. Chef wants to solve a series problem but he can't 
solve it till now.Can you help Chef to solve the series problem?

In series problem, the series goes as follows 1,9,31,73,141 . . . . . . . . 

Your task is to find the Nth term of series. For larger value of NN answer becomes very large, So your output should be performed NNth term modulo 1000000007 (109+7109+7 ).
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of a single integer NN. 

Output:
For each testcase,  output in a single line answer i.e. The NNth term of series modulo 1000000007.
Constraints

1≤N≤1091≤N≤109

Sample Input:
2
8
10
Sample Output:
561
1081
