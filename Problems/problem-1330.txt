Akash has just learned the maximum subarray sum problem. And while thinking about the solution, he came up with a new problem, the maximum frequent subarray sum problem.
In this problem, you will be given an array AA of NN integers. You have to choose a non-empty subarray with the maximum possible score. The score of a subarray is calculated as 
score(l,r)=(Al+⋯+Ar)⋅(occurrences)score(l,r)=(Al+⋯+Ar)⋅(occurrences)
 Here, occurrencesoccurrences is the number of occurrences of that subarray in AA.
Now Akash can't solve this problem, so please help him solve it.
Input

The first line contains an integer TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
The first line of each test case contains an integer nn, the size of the array.
The second line contains nn integers A1,…,ANA1,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, output the maximum possible score in a new line.

Explanation
In the first test case, the maximum score is attained by subarray [5,5][5,5], its score is (5+5)⋅2=20(5+5)⋅2=20 since it occurs twice in AA.
In the second test case, the maximum score is attained by both subarrays [1,7,−1,2,−4,10][1,7,−1,2,−4,10] and [1,7,−1,2,−4,10,0][1,7,−1,2,−4,10,0]. Both have sum 1515 and occur once, so their scores are 15⋅1=1515⋅1=15.
