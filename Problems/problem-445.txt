You are given a string AA of length NN, consisting of zeroes and ones. You want to partition it into blocks consisting of consecutive indices such that each block has an odd sum and has length at most mm. For each mm from 11 to NN, find the minimum number of blocks required, or report that it is impossible.
Input

The first line contains an integer TT, the number of test cases. Each test case contains two lines:
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN.
The second line of each test case contains a string A=a1a2…aNA=a1a2…aN. 

Output
For each test case, print NN space-separated integers. The mm-th of these integers should be the minimum number of blocks of length at most mm the array can be partitioned into, such that each block has an odd sum, or −1−1 if it is impossible to do so.
Constraints

1≤N≤1061≤N≤106
The sum of NN over all test cases doesn't exceed 106106.

Subtasks

Subtask 1 (9 Points): The sum of NN over all test cases doesn't exceed 200200.
Subtask 2 (13 Points): The sum of NN over all test cases doesn't exceed 25002500.
Subtask 3 (21 Points): The sum of NN over all test cases doesn't exceed 1500015000.
Subtask 4 (17 Points): The sum of NN over all test cases doesn't exceed 5000050000.
Subtask 5 (24 Points): The sum of NN over all test cases doesn't exceed 250000250000.
Subtask 6 (16 Points): No additional constraints.

Explanation
Clearly if m=1m=1, no such partitioning is possible, as the first block must consist of a single 00.
For m=2,3,4m=2,3,4, we can partition it as 0110101101. Note that 0110101101 is also a valid partition.
If m=5m=5, the partition consisting of a single block 0110101101 is valid as the total sum (33) is odd.
