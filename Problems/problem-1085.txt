A permutation PP of length NN (11-based) is called good if it satisfies the following these conditions:

For each 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N, Pi≠iPi≠i
|P1−1|⊕|P2−2|⊕…⊕|PN−N|=0|P1−1|⊕|P2−2|⊕…⊕|PN−N|=0

Here, ⊕⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation and |X||X| denotes the absolute value of XX.
Find any good permutation PP of length NN or print −1−1 if no such permutation exists.
Note: A permutation of length NN is an array which contains every integer from 11 to NN (inclusive) exactly once.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer NN - the length of the permutation PP.

Output Format
For each test case, print −1−1 if no such permutation exists. Otherwise, in a single line, output NN space-separated integers - the required good permutation. If more than one solution exists, you may print any of them.
Constraints

1≤T≤1061≤T≤106
1≤N≤1061≤N≤106
Sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 106106

Explanation
Test case 1: There is only one permutation P=[1]P=[1] of length 11. Since P1=1P1=1 the answer does not exist.
Test case 2: Consider the permutation P=[2,1]P=[2,1]. Both conditions are satisfied.

P1≠1P1≠1 and P2≠2P2≠2
|P1−1|⊕|P2−2|=|2−1|⊕|1−2|=1⊕1=0|P1−1|⊕|P2−2|=|2−1|⊕|1−2|=1⊕1=0

Test case 3: Both conditions are satisfied for P=[7,1,5,6,3,4,8,2]P=[7,1,5,6,3,4,8,2].
