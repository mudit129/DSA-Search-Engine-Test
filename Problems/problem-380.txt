Chef loves to cook pies. But more than that, he loves to play with numbers. And this task is one of his favorites. The goal is very simple: you need to select 3 numbers from an array of N numbers, such that their XOR will be maximal.
XOR - exclusive or (xor - in Pascal, ^ - in C++) 
 
Input
 The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a positive integer N denoting the number of integers in the given array. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN containing the elements of the array. 
Output
 For each test case, output a single line containing the  maximal XOR of 3 chosen numbers in the array. Note, that you have to choose exactly 3 numbers.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 3
3 ≤ N ≤ 2000
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 109

 
Example
Input:
2
3
