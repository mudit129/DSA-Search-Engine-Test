You are given three integers A, B and C. You may perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times: choose one of the numbers A, B, C and either add 1 to it or subtract 1 from it.
Find the minimum number of operations required to make the sequence A, B, C an arithmetic progression, i.e. a sequence which satisfies B - A = C - B.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers A, B and C.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum required number of operations.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10,000
-109 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 109

Subtasks

Explanation
Example case 1: No operations are needed because 0-(-5) = 5-0.
Example case 2: We can obtain an arithmetic progression in seven operations by adding 1 to A = -5 and subtracting 1 six times from B = 7.
Example case 3: We should add 1 to B 105 times.
