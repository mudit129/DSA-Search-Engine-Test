Chef Ceil has some matchsticks in his kitchen.
Detail of matchsticks:
There are NN matchsticks in total. They are numbered from to 00 to N−1N−1 inclusive. The ithith matchstick takes bibi time to burn when lighted at one end, and it burns at a uniform rate.
If lighted at both ends simultaneously, the matchstick will take only half of the original time to burn down.
Arrangement:
He ties rear end of the all the matchsticks together at one point and the front end is kept free. The matchstick numbered ii is adjacent to matchstick numbered i+1i+1 for all 0≤i≤N−20≤i≤N−2.  
Bodies of matchsticks do not touch each other, except at the rear end.
Task:
There are QQ queries, in each query we ask:
If he lights the free end of all matchsticks numbered between LL and RR inclusive, what will be the time needed for all matchsticks to get completely burnt?
Input

First line of input contains a single integer NN. 
The next line contains NN space separated integers, the ithith of which is bibi
The next line contains a single integer QQ
The next QQ lines each contain two space separated integers - LL and RR. The ithith line represents the ithith query.

Output
For each query, print the answer on a new line.

Explanation
Test Case 3: , in the figure above, yellow colored matches are lighted by a lighter simultaneously.
The numbers indicate the time required to burn that matchstick (if lighted at one end).
Now the first lighted matchstick will completely burn in 55 seconds. Then it will light up all the rest matches from the rear end.
Some matches will have fire at both ends and thus after 55 seconds, they will start burning with twice the original rate.
Thus time taken for matches to burn completely will be :
(from left to right):  8.08.0, 9.09.0, 7.07.0, 6.06.0, 5.05.0, 6.06.0, 7.07.0, 6.06.0, 7.57.5, 5.05.0, 8.58.5, 8.08.0, 6.06.0, 6.06.0, 7.07.0, 6.06.0, 8.08.0, 7.07.0.
So, the answer will be 9.09.0 (the maximum among these).
