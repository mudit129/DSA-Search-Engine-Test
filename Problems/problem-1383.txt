You are given an array aa (1 indexed)of size nn. You have to process following operations on the array 
1 ll rr : update elements of indices from ll to rr inclusive to difference of element and nearest strictly smaller prime (eg: 5 gets updated to 5-3=2). Also note that since 0,1,2 does not have primes below then even after update they remain the same.  
2 ll rr : Sum of elements of array from ll to rr indices 
Input
The first two lines of the input contains one integer each  n,q denoting the number of elements , number of queries 
 The third line contains nn integers giving the elements of the array. Let aiai denote  the ith element. 
The next q line contains queries as described as above
Output
Output description.
Output one integer for each query of 2nd type
