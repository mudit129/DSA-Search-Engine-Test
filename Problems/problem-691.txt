While doing his research in the Institute of Lovely Graphs, Rashad came up with another problem called Prime Graph.
Prime Graph is a simple graph (undirected graph which does not contain any self-loops or multiple-edges) with NN nodes such that the degree of each node is prime. Rashad wants to know what is the maximum number of edges a prime graph with NN nodes can contain. Can you help Rashad answer this question?
Note: The degree of a node in a simple graph is the number of edges that are incident on the node and a prime number is a natural number greater than 11 which has exactly two divisors - 11 and the number itself.
Input Format

The first line contains TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains NN - the number of nodes in the graph. 

Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum number of edges a prime graph of NN nodes can contain.

Explanation

For N=3N=3 and 44 we can construct a complete graph (a graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge). 
For N=5N=5 we can construct a prime graph with at most 77 edges. One such graph is:
