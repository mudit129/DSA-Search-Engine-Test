The kingdom of Treeland consists of NN cities (numbered 11 through NN) connected by N−1N−1 bidirectional roads in such a way that there is a path between each pair of cities.
In order to increase security in Treeland, the government decided to set up police offices in KK of its cities. For each valid ii, the ii-th office is in city ViVi and it has a radius of efficiency RiRi.
Let's define the security level SiSi of each city ii as follows:

Initially, the security level of each city is equal to zero.
Then, for each police office jj that was built (1≤j≤K1≤j≤K), the security levels change in the following manner:
The security level of the city VjVj increases by RjRj.
The security levels of all cities at the distance 11 from VjVj increase by Rj−1Rj−1.
…
The security levels of all cities at the distance Rj−1Rj−1 from VjVj increase by 11.
Formally, for each city ii, the jj-th office increases the security level of this city by max(0,Rj−distance(i,Vj))max(0,Rj−distance(i,Vj)).

Alice was in charge of calculating the new security levels of all cities after the offices were built. She already finished her job and noticed an interesting coincidence: for each valid ii, SVi=RiSVi=Ri holds. Now she has challenged you to find the security levels of all cities.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.
Then, N−1N−1 lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting that cities uu and vv are connected by a road.
KK more lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers ViVi and RiRi.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers S1,S2,…,SNS1,S2,…,SN.
