Gotham city is in danger. All the people from Gotham were airlifted and they are going to be dropped at different districts of a new safe city.
There are NN districts located at position (1,2,…,N)(1,2,…,N) in a straight line in this newly built safe city.
An array(P) is given which tells us about the maximum capacity of people that can be accommodated in the districts.
There is a condition that people can move only in the forward direction(i.e from city ii to i+1i+1 for 1≤i<N1≤i<N) to get shelter.
People want to travel as little as possible to get shelter.
The sad part is that in case any person who does not get shelter is going to die.
Initially, all the districts in the new city are empty.
You are asked QQ queries.

Each query consists of two Integers XX and KK, where KK denotes the number of people who are going to be dropped at district XX.
You are required to print the total sum of distance traveled by the people in the current query(that got shelter or did not die) in a new line.

Note:- Queries are not independent(they depend on the previous queries).
Input

First Line consists of one Integer NN, where NN is the number of districts.
Second line consists of NN integers of (array P) separated by a space.
Third Line contains an integer QQ, which denotes the number of queries.
Next, QQ lines consist of two integers XX and KK separated by space.

Output

For each query, you have to print the total sum of distance traveled by the people in the current query(that got shelter or did not die ) in a new line.

Explanation

Query 11: 55 people will get shelter in city 22 and the remaining 66 will get shelter in city 33. So, the total distance covered in this query is 66.
Query 22: Only 11 person can get shelter in city 44 and the rest will die. So, the total distance traveled is 22.
