This jump of the broken time machine again instead of taking you home, takes you to a future where you find yourself stuck in an alien invasion.
Aliens have NN spacecrafts (numbered from 00 to N−1N−1) to attack Earth and each spacecraft has a power PiPi. You encounter a helpful alien explorer, named Chitti, who gives you an Alien Technology weapon. Your task here is to help humans destroy these alien spacecrafts. To do so you use QQ weapons of two types.
Alien Tech : 11 xx yy
Alien spacecraft in the range xx to yy (inclusive) are attacking the Earth. To defend this attack you need to put up a shield barrier of power PP. Chitti gives you the secret method to calculate the power.
To find the power PP, you need to find the number of spacecrafts whose power is of the form 6∗s−16∗s−1, where s≥0s≥0. Let this be  LL.
Let the number of spacecrafts whose power is of the form 6∗t+16∗t+1, where t≥0t≥0 be RR. 
Now the actual power can be found by calculating the sum of all powers of spacecrafts in the range MinMin(LL%NN,RR%NN) to MaxMax(LL%NN,RR%NN) [inclusive].
Earthly Tech : 22 ii valval
You have a missile which on launch changes the power of spacecraft ii to value valval.
input:

The first line contains a single integer n denoting the number of spacecrafts
The second line contains NN space separated integers denoting the power of each
spacecraft.
The third line contains a single integer QQ denoting number of queries.
The next QQ lines contains query of either type 11 or 22.

Output

For query type 11 print a single integer denoting the power of shield barrier.

Explanation:

For the query 1 the number of terms of the fom 6n+1 in the range(0,3) is 2 and number of term of the form 6n-1 is 1. Sum of terms in range(1 ,2) is 2+13=15
Query 2 is to change value at index 1 to 1 new powers are 7 1 13 17 15
For the query 3 number of terms of the forms 6n+1 in the range(0,3) is 3 and number of term of the form 6*n-1 is 1 the sum(1,3) is 1+13+17=31
