There are NN integers in an array AA. 
Two players take turns alternatively in placing signs (+ or -) before them, and then they all are added. The sign can be placed before any element of the array that has not been assigned a sign yet. All elements must be assigned a sign.
Player 11 wins if the resulting sum is even, else player 22 wins. Find out who shall win if they both play optimally. 
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains 22 lines of input. 
First line contains a single integer NN, size of the array.
Second line contains NN space separated integers -  A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN, denoting the array elements.

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line "1", if the first person wins or "2" if the second person wins.

Explanation
Case 1: Lets consider all possible choices to prove that person 22 always has a winning chance regardless of what person 11 does.
1) Suppose person 11 adds a positive sign to 11, person 22 can also add a positive sign to 22 to get total of 33 which is odd: (+1)+(+2)=3(+1)+(+2)=3 
2) Suppose person 11 adds a negative sign to 11, person 22 can add a positive sign to 22 to get total of 11 which is odd: (−1)+(+2)=1(−1)+(+2)=1
3) Suppose person 11 adds a positive sign to 22, person 22 can also add a positive sign to 11 to get total of 33 which is odd: (+2)+(+1)=3(+2)+(+1)=3 
4) Suppose person 11 adds a negative sign to 22, person 22 can add a positive sign to 11 to get total of −1−1 which is odd: (−2)+(+1)=−1(−2)+(+1)=−1
