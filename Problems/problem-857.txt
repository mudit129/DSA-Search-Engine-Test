Sarthak has a set SS of NN distinct prime numbers. He grew very fond of that set, and now he only likes a positive integer XX if all of its prime factors belong to SS. Given the set and a positive integer MM, can you find out how many integers he likes which are not more than MM?
Note: Sarthak always like the number 11.
Input Format

The first line of each input contains TT - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM - the size of SS and the limit defined in the statement.
The second line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers S1,S2,…,SNS1,S2,…,SN - the elements of SS.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line the number of positive integers Sarthak likes that is not more than MM.
