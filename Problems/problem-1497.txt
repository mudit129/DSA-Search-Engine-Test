Consider the string of infinite length obtained by repeating abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz infinitely many times. That is, it looks like abc...xyzabc...xyzabc... 
Let string BB be the prefix of this string of length MM. For example,

if M=6M=6, B=B= abcdef
if M=29M=29, B=B= abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabc

Vedansh calls a string XX special if it contains BB as a substring. Formally, XX is special if for some 1≤L≤R≤|X|1≤L≤R≤|X|, XL…R=BXL…R=B.
Vedansh has string SS of length NN (consisting of lowercase Latin letters only). He wants to convert SS into a special string. To do so he can perform the following operation:

Pick an ii such that 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N and delete SiSi. The remaining parts of SS are concatenated.

Since Vedansh is lazy, he wants to do this in the minimum number of operations or determine if SS cannot be converted to a special string. Help Vedansh in doing so.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer TT — the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
Each test case consists of three lines of input
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN — the length of the string SS.
The second line of each test case contains the string SS which consists of lowercase Latin letters only.
The third line of each test case contains an integer MM — the length of the string BB whose form is described in the statement.

Output Format
For each test case, if AA can be converted to a special string, output the minimum number of operations to do so. Otherwise output −1−1.
Constraints

1≤T≤10001≤T≤1000
1≤M≤N≤1061≤M≤N≤106
SS consists of only lowercase Latin letters
It is guaranteed that the sum of NN over all test case does not exceed 106106.

Explanation
Test case 11: M=4M=4, so B=abcdB=abcd. We can delete the following characters from SS:
ababbdcedababbdced →→ ababcd–––––ababcd_, which has BB as a substring.
Test case 22: M=5M=5, so B=abcdeB=abcde. It can be shown that SS can not be converted into a special string.
Test case 33: M=3M=3, so B=abcB=abc. We can delete the following characters from SS:
acbcbdacbcbd →→ abc–––bdabc_bd, which has BB as a substring.
