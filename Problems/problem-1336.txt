Kartik gave Abhijay a Circular array AA of NN elements numbered 00 to N−1N−1 in clockwise order.  Since the array is circular the element after AAN−1N−1 is AA00. He also gave him QQ queries which he needs to answer on the basis of the given array.
The queries are of two types:

00 LL RR: The values AALL and AARR are swapped.
11 LL RR: Answer to this query is total no of integers which occur odd number of times in the subarray AALL,AAL+1L+1,AAL+2L+2…. AARR (in clockwise fashion).

Help Abhijay to answer each query of type 2 .  
Input:

The first line contains TT, number of test cases. The testcases follow.
For each test case the first line contains a single integer NN , the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains NN space separated non-negative integers AA00 , AA11 , AA22 …. AAN−1N−1
The third line contains a single integer QQ, number of queries.
Then QQ lines follow, each line contains three space separated integers XX LL RR describing a query.

Output:

For each query of type 2 i.e for each query where X=1X=1 output a single line containing one integer, the answer to the query.

Constraints:

1≤T≤101≤T≤10
1≤N≤1051≤N≤105
0≤0≤ AAii ≤2000≤2000
1≤Q≤1051≤Q≤105
0≤X≤10≤X≤1
0≤L,R≤N−10≤L,R≤N−1
Sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 2∗1052∗105. 
Sum of QQ over all test cases does not exceed 2∗1052∗105.

Sample Input:
1
6
5 2 3 3 3 2
4
1 1 5
0 0 5
1 1 5
1 4 1

Sample Output:
1
3
2

EXPLANATION:
For the first query only 3 occurs odd number of times in the subarray from [1,5].
Second query changes the array to [ 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 5 ].
For the third query elements 3,5,2 all occur odd number of times in the subarray from [1,5].  
For the last query covering indices  4, 5, 0, 1 the elements 3,5 occur odd number of times .
