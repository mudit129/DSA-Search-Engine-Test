You are given a positive integer KK and an array AA consisting of NN non-negative integers. Find the lexicographically smallest sequence BB that satisfies the following conditions

We can obtain BB by rearranging the elements in AA.
The length of longest non-decreasing subsequence of BB is equal to KK.

If no such sequence exists, print −1−1.
Input Format

First line of the input contains TT, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
First line of each test case contains two space separated integers NN and KK.
Second line of each test case contains NN space separated integers describing the array AA.

Output Format
For each test case, output the array BB in a single line with a space between two consecutive elements. And output −1−1 if no such array BB exists.

Explanation
There are 66 arrays that are rearrangements of the array [2,1,3][2,1,3].

[1,2,3][1,2,3] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 33.
[1,3,2][1,3,2] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 22.
[2,1,3][2,1,3] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 22.
[2,3,1][2,3,1] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 22.
[3,1,2][3,1,2] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 22.
[3,2,1][3,2,1] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 11.

Test case 1:
Observe from the list above that [3,2,1][3,2,1] is the only rearrangement of [2,1,3][2,1,3] with the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 11. And hence [3,2,1][3,2,1] is the lexicographically smallest that satisfies the given conditions.
Test case 2:
Observe from the above list the [1,3,2][1,3,2] is the lexicographically smallest among all those rearrangements with the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 22. And hence [1,3,2][1,3,2] is the lexicographically smallest that satisfies the given conditions.
Test case 3:
Observe from the list above that [1,2,3][1,2,3] is the only rearrangement of [2,1,3][2,1,3] with the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 33. And hence [1,2,3][1,2,3] is the lexicographically smallest that satisfies the given conditions.
Test case 4:
There are only 33 possible ways to rearrange [2,2,3][2,2,3].

[2,2,3][2,2,3] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 33.
[2,3,2][2,3,2] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 22.
[3,2,2][3,2,2] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 22.

So there does not exist any rearrangement of [2,2,3][2,2,3] with the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 11.
