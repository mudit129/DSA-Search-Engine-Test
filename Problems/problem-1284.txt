You are given a sequence of integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and an integer MM.
For any valid integers p,qp,q, let's define F(p,q)F(p,q) as the dot product of the subsequences Ap,Ap+1,…,Ap+M−1Ap,Ap+1,…,Ap+M−1 and Aq,Aq+1,…,Aq+M−1Aq,Aq+1,…,Aq+M−1, i.e. F(p,q)=∑M−1i=0Ap+i⋅Aq+iF(p,q)=∑i=0M−1Ap+i⋅Aq+i.
You should process QQ queries. In each query:

You are given two integers pospos and valval. Change the value of AposApos to valval.
Then, find the sum S=∑N−M+1i=1∑N−M+1j=1F(i,j)S=∑i=1N−M+1∑j=1N−M+1F(i,j). Since this sum could be very large, compute it modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, MM and QQ.
The second line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers representing A1,A2,...ANA1,A2,...AN.
QQ lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers pospos and valval describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer SS modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.
