There are nn piles of coins, where the iith pile has aiai coins. You need to collect the maximum number of coins from these piles, but you must fulfill the following condition: 
Let's say you pick xixi coins from the iith pile, then:

xx1+xx3+xx5… = xx2+xx4+xx6
0≤xi≤ai0≤xi≤ai

For example, if nn=3 and, aa=[2,3,2], you can pick the coins as xx= [1,2,1] becuase xx1+xx3=1+1=2 and xx2=2
Find the maximum total number of coins you can pick.
Input:

The first line of input contains a single integer nn denoting the number of piles.
The second line of input contains nn space-separated integers aiai, where the iith integer denoted the number of coins in iith pile.

Output:
Print a single integer denoting the maximum total number of coins you can pick.
Constraints

2≤n≤1052≤n≤105
1≤ai≤1031≤ai≤103

Sample Input:
4
5 1 1 4

Sample Output:
10

Explanation:
Let xx=[4,1,1,4] hence xx1+xx3=xx2+xx4 and total number of coins picked is 10. It can be checked that it is not possible to pick any greater number of coins.
