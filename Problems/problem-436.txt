You are provided a number NN. In one step, you can either divide NN by 6(6(if NN is 0)0) or multiply NN by 22 .
Find the minimum number of steps required to get 11 from NN or check if it is not possible.
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
The only line of the test case contains a number NN .

Output:
For each test case, print 

the minimum number of steps required to get 11 from NN, it is possible to do          
−1−1, it is impossible to obtain 11 from NN.

Constraints

1≤T≤2⋅1041≤T≤2⋅104
1≤N≤1091≤N≤109
NN is integer

Sample Input:
    4
    1
    2
    3
    15116544

Sample Output:
    0
   -1
    2
    12

EXPLANATION:
Consider the fourth test case.
Divide NN by 66 four times in a row and get 1166411664 (Updated NN).
Multiply NN by 22 and get 2332823328.
Divide NN by 66 three times in a row and get 108108 (Updated NN).
Multiply by 22 and get 216216
Divide NN by 66 three times in a row and get 11.
