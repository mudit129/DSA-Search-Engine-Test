You are given a tree with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN). Its edges are numbered 11 through N−1N−1. For each valid ii, there is an integer aiai written on the ii-th vertex. Also, for each valid ii, there is an integer bibi written on the ii-th edge.
You want the following condition to be satisfied: for each vertex vv and each edge ee adjacent to vv, av≥beav≥be. In order to achieve that, you may perform an arbitrary number of steps (including zero). In one step, you may perform one the following operations:

Select two different vertices uu and vv. Swap auau and avav.
Select two different edges ee and ff. Swap bebe and bfbf.
Select a vertex vv and an integer xx. Change avav to xx and pay one coin.

Calculate the minimum number of coins you need in order to satisfy the required condition.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
N−1N−1 lines follow. For each ii (1≤i≤N−11≤i≤N−1), the ii-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers uiui, vivi and bibi denoting that the ii-th edge connects vertices uiui and vivi and the initial value written on it is bibi.
The last line contains NN space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aNa1,a2,…,aN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum necessary number of coins.

Explanation
Example case 1: There is no way to satisfy the required condition without paying any coins. When we have one coin, we can perform the following operations:

Swap the integers written on vertices 11 and 22.
Pay one coin and change the integer written on vertex 22 to 77.
