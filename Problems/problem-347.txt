Chef has NN items in his Shop (numbered 11 through NN); And for Each valid ii (11<=ii<=NN).       the weight of the i−thi−th item is WiWi. Since Chef is very sensitive in nature.
Chef wants to arrange all even weights items one side and odd weights items on another side. Chef can arrange two adjacent items with help of swapping at one operation.
Chef wants a minimum number of operations required to arrange All Even weights item on one side and All Odd weights item to the another side.
Chef can’t solve this problem so he asks you to solve it. Help Chef to solve this problem.
Input:

First-line will contain TT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
The first line of each test case contains a single line integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers
W1W1,W2W2,…,WNWN

Output:
Print the minimum number of operations required Chef can make it. If Chef can't take any operations, print 0.
Constraints

1≤T≤1001≤T≤100
2≤N≤1052≤N≤105
3≤Wi≤1053≤Wi≤105
The sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅1053⋅105

Sample Input:
3
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
5
5 7 3 10 20
3
1 8 7

Sample Output:
3
0
1

EXPLANATION:
Example case 1:  You can arrange all even numbers right side. 
Numbers of swaps 66 arrange at position 6th6th is 00 operations, 44 arrange at position 5th5th is 11 operations, 22 arrange at position 4th4th is 22 operations.
Given array [1,2,3,4,5,6][1,2,3,4,5,6] to [1,3,5,2,4,6][1,3,5,2,4,6]
Total : 0 + 1 + 2 = 3 operations
Example case 2: Initially All odd number one side and all even number another side, so minimum number of operations : 0.
