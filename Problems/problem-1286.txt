You are given a rooted tree with NN nodes numbered 1,2,…,N1,2,…,N. Node 11 is the root node. Some of the nodes have a token in them. In one move, you can choose a non-root node that has a token, but its parent doesn't, and move the token from this node to its parent. What is the maximum number of moves you can make?
Note: When a token is moved out of a node, the node becomes empty, and other tokens will be able to move there.
Input

The first line contains an integer TT, the number of test cases. Each test case contains three lines.
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN, the number of nodes in the tree.
The second line contains a string ss of length NN. The character sisi is 11 if node has a token, and 00 otherwise.
The third line contains N−1N−1 space separated integers, p2,p3,…pNp2,p3,…pN, where pipi is the parent of node ii.

Output
For each test case, print the maximum number of moves that can be made on a new line.
Constraints

1≤N≤1061≤N≤106
For each valid ii,  1≤pi<i1≤pi<i.
The sum of NN over all test cases doesn't exceed 106106.

Subtasks

Subtask 1 (13 points): T≤10,N≤17T≤10,N≤17.

Explanation
In the first test case, you can first move a token from node 44 to node 33, and then move a token from node 22 to node 11.
In the second test case, there are no possible valid moves.
