Given KK arrays of length NN where the elements are bounded in the range [L,R][L,R].
The Function value of an array is defined as the sum of all elements present in it.
In one move you can change at most 11 element from all the arrays and the changed value must lie within the range [L,R][L,R]. 
What is the minimum number of operations required to make the function value of all arrays equal?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers KK, NN, LL, RR.
Next KK lines contains an array of length NN.

Output
For each test case, print the minimum number of operations needed to make the function value of all arrays equal in a new line.

Explanation

Change array 11 to [1,3,2][1,3,2]
No change in array 22 
Change array 33 to [1,2,3][1,2,3]
Change array 44 to [1,2,3][1,2,3]
Sum of all arrays is equal.
