 
Once upon a time there was a kingdom called Ladoo Land. Ladooland had recently
been at war with Gol Gappa Land. The Senapati of Ladooland played a major role and 
won the war for his kingdom. 
The king was extremely pleased with his Senapati. So he organised a great parade to 
honour his Senapati Ladoo Veer. 
The Senapati was rewarded handsomely with ladoos. He felt that he would not be able to 
eat all the ladoos, so he decided to give away N ladoos amongst his M soldiers. 
The Senapati asked his son Ladoo Singh to distribute the ladoos in a way that each soldier 
gets at least 2 ladoos. 
Can you help Ladoo Singh help find the number of ways to do so?.
