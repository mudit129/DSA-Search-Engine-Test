You are given two spanning trees T1T1 and T2T2 on the same set of NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN). For each edge e1e1 in T1T1, you have to calculate the number of edges e2∈T2e2∈T2 which satisfy the following conditions:

T1−e1+e2T1−e1+e2 (the graph formed by removing the edge e1e1 from T1T1 and adding the edge e2e2) is a spanning tree
T2−e2+e1T2−e2+e1 is also a spanning tree

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
Each of the following N−1N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting an edge in T1T1 between vertices uu and vv.
The following N−1N−1 lines describe the edges of T2T2 in the same format.

Output
For each test case, print N−1N−1 space-separated integers — the number of valid edges e2e2 for each edge e1∈T1e1∈T1 (in the order in which they are given on the input).
