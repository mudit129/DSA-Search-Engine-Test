You are given a string SS of length NN, which consists of digits from 00 to 99. You can apply the following operation to the string:

Choose an integer LL with 1≤L≤N1≤L≤N and apply Si=(Si+1)mod10Si=(Si+1)mod10 for each 1≤i≤L1≤i≤L.

For example, if S=39590S=39590, then choosing L=3L=3 and applying the operation yields the string S=406––––90S=406_90.
The prefix of string SS of length l(1≤l≤∣S∣)l(1≤l≤∣S∣) is string S1S2…SlS1S2…Sl. A prefix of length ll is called good if S1=0,S2=0,…,Sl=0S1=0,S2=0,…,Sl=0. Find the length of the longest good prefix that can be obtained in string SS by applying the given operation maximum KK times.
Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The TT test cases then follow:
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N,KN,K.
The second line of each test case contains the string SS.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the length of the longest good prefix that can be obtained in string SS by applying the given operation maximum KK times.

Explanation
Test case 11: There is no way to obtain zeros on the prefix of the string S=380S=380 by applying the given operation maximum 55 times.
Test case 22: The optimal strategy is: choose L=2L=2 and apply the operation twice, resulting in S=500S=500, then choose L=1L=1 and apply the operation 55 times, resulting in S=000S=000.
Test case 44: One of the possible sequence of operations is the following:

Choose L=5L=5 and apply the operation thrice, resulting in S=01045S=01045.
Choose L=2L=2 and apply the operation 99 times, resulting in S=90045S=90045. 
Choose L=1L=1 and apply the operation once, resulting in S=00045S=00045.
