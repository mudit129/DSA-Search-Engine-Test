You are given a graph GG with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN) and MM edges. You should partition the vertices of GG into two sets AA and BB such that:

each vertex of GG belongs to exactly one of these sets
AA is non-empty
AA is an independent set in GG, i.e. for each pair of vertices u,v∈Au,v∈A, GG does not contain an edge (u,v)(u,v)
for each vertex a∈Aa∈A and each vertex b∈Bb∈B, there is an edge (a,b)(a,b) in GG

Find the number of such partitions (A,B)(A,B). Also, give an example of one of these partitions or determine that no such partition exists.
Two partitions are considered different if there is a vertex that is in the set AA in one partition and in the set BB in the other partition.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.
Each of the next MM lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting that vertices uu and vv are connected by an edge.

Output
For each test case, print two lines.

The first of these lines should contain a single integer — the number of partitions satisfying the given conditions.
The second line should contain a single string with length NN. If there are no partitions satisfying the given conditions, each character of this string should be '0'. Otherwise, this string should describe one such partition — for each valid ii, the ii-th character should be '1' if vertex ii belongs to AA or '0' if it belongs to BB.
