Chef has an integer NN and he wants to generate a matrix MM with NN rows (numbered 11 through NN) and NN columns (numbered 11 through NN). He thinks that MM would be delicious if:

Each element of this matrix is an integer between 11 and N2N2 inclusive.
All the elements of the matrix are pairwise distinct.
For each square submatrix containing cells in rows rr through r+ar+a and in columns cc through c+ac+a (inclusive) for some valid integers rr, cc and a≥0a≥0:
Mr,c+Mr+a,c+aMr,c+Mr+a,c+a is even
Mr,c+a+Mr+a,cMr,c+a+Mr+a,c is even

Can you help Chef generate a delicious matrix? It can be proved that a solution always exists. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer NN.

Output
For each test case, print NN lines describing a delicious matrix MM. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines should contain NN space-separated integers Mi,1,Mi,2,…,Mi,NMi,1,Mi,2,…,Mi,N.
Constraints

1≤T≤101≤T≤10
1≤N≤1031≤N≤103
the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 103103

Explanation
Example case 1: The matrix MM has five square submatrices. Four of them ([1][1], [2][2], [4][4], [3][3]) have a=0a=0, so they obviously satisfy all conditions. The last square submatrix is the whole matrix MM, with r=c=a=1r=c=a=1, and we can see that M1,1+M2,2=1+3=4M1,1+M2,2=1+3=4 and M1,2+M2,1=2+4=6M1,2+M2,1=2+4=6 are both even.
