Chef went to the store in order to buy one can of coke. In the store, they offer NN cans of coke (numbered 11 through NN). For each valid ii, the current temperature of the ii-th can is CiCi and its price is PiPi.
After buying a can of coke, Chef wants to immediately start walking home; when he arrives, he wants to immediately drink the whole can. It takes Chef MM minutes to get home from the store. However, Chef does not know the value of MM yet.
The ambient temperature outside is KK. When a can of coke is outside, its temperature approaches the ambient temperature. Specifically, if its temperature is tt at some point in time:

if t>K+1t>K+1, then one minute later, its temperature will be t−1t−1
if t<K−1t<K−1, then one minute later, its temperature will be t+1t+1
if K−1≤t≤K+1K−1≤t≤K+1, then one minute later, its temperature will be KK

When Chef drinks coke from a can, he wants its temperature to be between LL and RR (inclusive). For each ii between 11 and QQ inclusive, find the cheapest can for which this condition is satisfied when M=iM=i or determine that there is no such can.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains five space-separated integers NN, QQ, KK, LL and RR.
NN lines follow. For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers CiCi and PiPi.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing QQ space-seperated integers. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these integers should be the answer for M=iM=i: the price of the can Chef should buy, or −1−1 if it is impossible to buy a can such that Chef's condition is satisfied.
