Chef has an array AA containing NN integers. The integers of the array can be positive, negative, or even zero.
Chef allows you to choose at most KK elements of the array and multiply them by −1−1.
Find the maximum sum of a subsequence you can obtain if you choose the elements of the subsequence optimally. 
Note: A sequence aa is a subsequence of a sequence bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. For example, [3,1][3,1] is a subsequence of [3,2,1][3,2,1] and [4,3,1][4,3,1], but not a subsequence of [1,3,3,7][1,3,3,7] and [3,10,4][3,10,4]. Note that empty sequence is also a subsequence. 
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N,KN,K.
The second line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,...,ANA1,A2,...,AN

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the maximum sum of a subsequence you can obtain.

Explanation
Test case 11: It is optimal to multiply −10,−4−10,−4 with −1−1 and then take the subsequence [6,10,4,2][6,10,4,2].
Test case 22: It is optimal to choose empty subsequence with a sum equal to 00.
Test case 33: We can take subsequence [1,2,3][1,2,3]. Here, we do not multiply −1−1 with any element.
