Please note that the two versions of this problem differ only by constraints. The problem statement is exactly the same in both.
You are given two strings AA and BB of lengths NN and MM respectively. Find the maximum length of a substring of AA that is also present in BB. Let this maximum length be KK. Also, find all such substrings of length KK that is present in both AA and BB and print the number of times each such substring occurs in BB. 
Input:

First line contains a single integer TT, the number of test cases.
First line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, NN and MM.
Second line of each test case contains two space-separated strings, AA and BB.

Output:
For each test case, output in the first line KK, the maximum length of a common substring. Then follows XX lines of output, where XX denotes the number of substrings in AA of length KK that is also present in BB. In each such line, print the substring of length KK present in both the strings and the number of times that substring occurs in BB (separated by a single space). The substrings must follow a lexicographic order, i.e., you must first print the substring that will occur earlier in a dictionary than the others.
