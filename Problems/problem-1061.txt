You are given a binary string SS with length NN and an integer KK, which is a divisor of NN. A string is said to be KK-foldable if it can be changed to a string with length KK by repeating the following process without any collisions (defined below):

Select the prefix of the current string SS with length 2K2K. (Note that as long as the length of SS is greater than KK, this prefix always exists.)
For each ii (1≤i≤K1≤i≤K), check if the 2K−i+12K−i+1-th character of SS is equal to the ii-th character of SS ― if they are not equal, there is a collision and the process is invalid.
Erase the prefix of SS with length KK.

Your goal is to reorder the characters of SS (possibly leaving this string unchanged) in such a way that the resulting string SS is a KK-foldable string. Find a way to do that or determine that it is impossible. If there are multiple solutions, find the lexicographically smallest rearranged string which is KK-foldable.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.
The second line contains a single string SS with length NN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the smallest rearranged string or the string "IMPOSSIBLE" if it is impossible to rearrange SS.
Constraints

1≤T≤1001≤T≤100
1≤K≤N≤1031≤K≤N≤103
NN is divisible by KK
SS contains only characters '0' and '1'

01100110
IMPOSSIBLE
Explanation
Example case 1: If the given string "00011101" is rearranged to "01100110", it becomes 22-foldable:

Initially, SS is "01100110".
After the first folding, it becomes "100110".
After the second folding, it becomes "0110".
After the third folding, it becomes "10". This string has length 22, so we are done.

Example case 2: It is impossible to rearrange SS into a 22-foldable string.
