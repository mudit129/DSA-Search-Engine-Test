You are given an undirected graph with NN nodes (numbered 11 through NN). For each valid ii, the ii-th node has a weight WiWi. Also, for each pair of nodes ii and jj, there is an edge connecting these nodes if j−i≠Wj−Wij−i≠Wj−Wi.
Find the number of connected components in this graph.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers W1,W2,…,WNW1,W2,…,WN.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer --- the number of connected components in the graph.

Explanation
Example case 1: For i=1i=1 and j=2j=2, we have 2−1=2−12−1=2−1, therefore there are no edges in the graph and there are two connected components.
Example case 2: For i=1i=1 and j=2j=2, we have 2−1≠1−22−1≠1−2, therefore there is an edge between 11 and 22, the graph is connected, so there is only one connected component.
