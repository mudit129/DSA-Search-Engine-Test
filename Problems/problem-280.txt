The MEX of a set of integers is defined as the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to this set. For example, MEX({0,2,3})=1MEX({0,2,3})=1 and MEX({1,3})=0MEX({1,3})=0.
Chef has a tree with NN nodes (numbered 11 through NN). The tree is rooted at node 11. Chef wants to assign a non-negative integer to each node in such a way that each integer between 00 and N−1N−1 (inclusive) is assigned to exactly one node.
For each node uu, consider the integers assigned to the nodes in the subtree of uu (including uu); let auau denote the MEX of these integers. Chef wants a1+a2+…+aNa1+a2+…+aN to be as large as possible. Find the maximum possible value of this sum.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains N−1N−1 space-separated integers p1,p2,…,pN−1p1,p2,…,pN−1. For each valid ii, the node pipi is the parent of the node i+1i+1.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum sum of subtree MEX-s which can be obtained if you assign the weights optimally.
