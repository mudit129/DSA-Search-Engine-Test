You are given a tree with NN nodes (numbered 11 through NN). A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.
You have to assign an integer to each node; for each valid ii, let's denote the integer assigned to node ii by AiAi. This assignment must satisfy the following conditions:

For each valid ii, 1≤Ai≤1051≤Ai≤105.
For each simple path in the tree which contains at least two nodes, let's denote the set of nodes in this path by SS. Then, ∑v∈SAv∑v∈SAv is not divisible by |S||S|.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
Each of the next N−1N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting that nodes uu and vv are connected by an edge.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them. It can be proved that a solution always exists under the given constraints.

Explanation
Example case 1:

This assignment satisfies all the conditions. For example, for the path 3→5→1→23→5→1→2, the sum 12+9+4+9=3412+9+4+9=34 is not divisible by 44 (the number of nodes in the path).
