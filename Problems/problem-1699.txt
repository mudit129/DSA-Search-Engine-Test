We know that there is a hidden sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN which contains only integers between 11 and KK inclusive. We have acquired MM triplets (X1,Y1,Z1),(X2,Y2,Z2),…,(XM,YM,ZM)(X1,Y1,Z1),(X2,Y2,Z2),…,(XM,YM,ZM). A very reliable source has given us intel that for each valid ii, the YiYi-th occurrence of the integer XiXi in the sequence AA is AZiAZi, i.e. AZi=XiAZi=Xi and there are Yi−1Yi−1 indices j<Zij<Zi such that Aj=XiAj=Xi.
Find any sequence AA consistent with this information or determine that no such sequence exists.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, KK and MM.
MM lines follow. For each ii (1≤i≤M1≤i≤M), the ii-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers Xi,YiXi,Yi and ZiZi.

Output
For each test case:

If no valid sequence exists, print a single line containing the string "No".
Otherwise, print two lines.
The first of these lines should contain the string "Yes".
The second line should contain NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
