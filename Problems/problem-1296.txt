After solving some Number Theory related problems KBG challenged VD to solve following problem.
You are given an array AA consisting of NN positive integers and QQ queries. Each query is of the form:

LL RR: Given two integers LL and RR (1≤L<R≤N)(1≤L<R≤N), let BB denote the subarray A[L,R]A[L,R]. Find the maximum possible GCD of any subsequence of BB which has length greater than 11.

For each query, find the maximum possible GCDGCD of any subsequence in the given range having length greater than 11.
Input Format

First line contains TT, number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a two space-separated integer NN and QQ - length of the array and number of queries respectively.
The second line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,...,ANA1,A2,...,AN.
Next QQ lines of each test case contains two space-separated integers LL and RR.

Output Format
For each test case, print QQ lines. The ithith line contains one integer - the answer for the ithith query.

Explanation
Test Case 11: Given A=[5,4,15,6,10,8]A=[5,4,15,6,10,8] and 22 queries.

In the first query, L=1L=1 and R=5R=5. Thus, the subarray B=[5,4,15,6,10]B=[5,4,15,6,10]. One of the subsequences of BB having maximum GCD and length greater than 11 is [5,15,10][5,15,10]. The GCD of this subsequence is GCD(5,15,10)=5GCD(5,15,10)=5. It can be proven that no other subsequence of BB having length greater than 11 has a GCD greater than 55.
In the second query, L=4L=4 and R=6R=6. Thus, the subarray B=[6,10,8]B=[6,10,8]. One of the subsequences of BB having maximum GCD and length greater than 11 is [6,10,8][6,10,8]. The GCD of this subsequence is GCD(6,10,8)=2GCD(6,10,8)=2. It can be proven that no other subsequence of BB having length greater than 11 has a GCD greater than 22.
