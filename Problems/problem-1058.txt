You are given an array AA with NN integers. You have to tell Chef whether this array is closed under multiplication. 
We say that an array is closed under multiplication if, for all sequences 1≤S1<S2<⋯<Sk≤N1≤S1<S2<⋯<Sk≤N,  there exists 1≤x≤N1≤x≤N such that AS1⋅AS2⋅⋯⋅ASk=AxAS1⋅AS2⋅⋯⋅ASk=Ax. 
Output 1 if it is closed, and 0 otherwise.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer - NN
The second line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers - the ithith of which is AiAi

Output Format
For each test case, output the answer on a new line. Output 11 if AA is closed under multiplication, and 00 otherwise. 
Constraints

1≤T,N≤1051≤T,N≤105
−109≤Ai≤109−109≤Ai≤109
The sum of NN across all test cases does not exceed 106106

Explanation
Test case 11: [1,0,3][1,0,3] is closed under multiplication.
A1⋅A2=1⋅0=0=A2A1⋅A2=1⋅0=0=A2
A1⋅A2⋅A3=1⋅0⋅3=0=A2A1⋅A2⋅A3=1⋅0⋅3=0=A2
A1⋅A3=1⋅3=3=A3A1⋅A3=1⋅3=3=A3
A2⋅A3=0⋅3=0=A2A2⋅A3=0⋅3=0=A2
Therefore, the answer for the first test case is 11.
Test case 22: [1,−1,−1][1,−1,−1] is closed under multiplication.
A1⋅A2=1⋅−1=−1=A2A1⋅A2=1⋅−1=−1=A2
A1⋅A2⋅A3=1⋅−1⋅−1=1=A1A1⋅A2⋅A3=1⋅−1⋅−1=1=A1
A1⋅A3=1⋅−1=−1=A2A1⋅A3=1⋅−1=−1=A2
A2⋅A3=−1⋅−1=1=A1A2⋅A3=−1⋅−1=1=A1
Therefore, the answer for the second test case is 11.
Test case 33: A2⋅A3=3⋅3=9A2⋅A3=3⋅3=9 is not present in the array. Therefore, [1,3,3][1,3,3] is not closed under multiplication, and the answer is 00.
