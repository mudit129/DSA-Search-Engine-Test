Belal is a great math lover. He used to solve math problems to quench his thirst. He got stuck in solving the following problem. Given an equation  X1 + X2 + ... + XN = K .  and an array of N numbers a1,a2,...,aN. The task is to find the number of whole number solutions satisfying the given equation such that Xi >= ai for all i (1<=i<=N). Since the no of solutions can be large, print them modulo 109 + 7. 
Input

The first line of the input consist of two integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN.

Output

Print the number of solutions modulo 109 + 7.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
1 ≤ K ≤ 100000
1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000

Example
Input:
2 4
1 1
Output:
3

Explanation
The possible solutions are as follows:
1) X1 = 1,X2 = 3;
2) X1 = 3,X2 = 1;
3) X1 = 2,X2 = 2;

Thus the total number of solutions = 3;
