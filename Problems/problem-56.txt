You are given an array AA with length NN. On each day, the following process was performed:

a new array RR is created; this array contains all elements AiAi such that i=1i=1, i=Ni=N or min(Ai−1,Ai+1)≤Aimin⁡(Ai−1,Ai+1)≤Ai (2≤i<N2≤i<N), in the original order
AA is replaced by RR and NN is replaced by the length of RR

In other words, all elements of AA that are between two bigger elements disappear.
For each element of the original array, calculate the number of the day on which it disappeared (the process starts with day 11), or determine that it never disappeared.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these integers should be the number of the day on which the ii-th element of the original array disappeared, or 00 if it never disappeared.
