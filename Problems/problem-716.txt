Ratan Singh and Alauddin Khilji are blood-enemies of each other. Ratan Singh has a diverse and well planned kingdom. His kingdom has NN provinces. Every province has a  bidirectional road to every other province (except itself of course). But Alauddin has now attacked his kingdom. During his attack, he destroyed some of the roads connecting provinces.
To fight back, Ratan Singh divided his sena(army) into two senas. Sena XX and Sena YY.
Sena XX has the best warriors, while Sena YY doesn’t. According to his plan, each province should be protected by exactly one of the two senas( XX or YY).
As Sena XX is very strong, Ratan Singh will place them in such a way that: 

No two adjacent provinces (provinces connected by a road) are guarded by Sena XX. 
If a province PP is guarded by Sena XX, then all the provinces which are guarded by Sena YY needs to be adjacent to province PP. 
There should exist at least one province having Sena XX, and at least one province having Sena YY.

This way, he can ensure the safety of his Kingdom.
You are the only programmer that Khilji has. You have to help him calculate the number of possible ways in which Ratan Singh can achieve the aforementioned task!
NOTE : Please use Fast I/O methods as the input can be large.
Input Format

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
First line of each test-case consists of two spaced integers, NN and MM, denoting the number of provinces in Ratan Singh's Kingdom, and the number of roads destroyed by Khilji respectively.
Then, MM lines follow:
Each of these lines consists of two spaced integers, uu vv, denoting that the road connecting provinces uu and vv has been destroyed by Khilji. 

Output Format
For each testcase, print the number of possible ways in which Ratan Singh can deploy his Senas, following the conditions mentioned in the statement.

Explanation

The only possible way to deploy the senas is, deploy the Sena XX at provinces :[1,6][1,6] and the ena YY at provinces : [3,2,4,5][3,2,4,5]. For any of the provinces having Sena XX, it can be seen that, every province of sena YY is adjacent to it. Province 11 is adjacent to [3,2,4,5][3,2,4,5], the same follows for the province 66.
He cannot deploy sena XX at [3,2,4,5][3,2,4,5] and YY at [1,6][1,6] because in the resulting graph, provinces 3,23,2 as well as provinces 3,43,4 are adjacent.
