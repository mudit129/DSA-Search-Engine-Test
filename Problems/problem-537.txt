Egor came to the Olympiad in Informatics. But the tasks turned out to be too difficult, so Egor chose to sleep instead of solving problems. But as we all know, everyone is very happy when someone is the first who solved the problem. 
There are NN problems in the contest. The ii-th of them was solved at minute LiLi for the first time. This task will stop increasing the joy of everyone around at the minute Ri+1Ri+1 (that is, RiRi is the last minute when the task increases the joy). In other words, the ii-th task increases the joyfulness for everyone by 11 unit from the minute LiLi to the minute RiRi.
In the anime that Egor watched recently, there are various techniques that can make a person fall asleep. Egor knows techniques that will allow him to sleep for any minutes between AA and BB minutes, i.e. Egor can sleep for AA minutes, A+1A+1 minutes, …, BB minutes. Egor can also combine techniques, i.e. he can choose techniques with different duration and then sleep the total time of all techniques.
Egor wants to combine techniques to wake up in the most joyful moment possible. Your task is to find the maximum joy in which Egor can wake up.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains the number TT - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains integers NN, AA, and BB - the number of tasks and A,BA,B values described in the statement.
The next NN lines give you a description of the problems. Each line contains two numbers Li,RiLi,Ri - a segment of joy for every task.

Output Format
For each test case, print the maximum level of joy at which Egor can wake up.

Explanation

Test case 11: We can use techniques 11 and 22 to wake up at minute 1+2=31+2=3. At that time, there are 22 tasks that give Egor joy: task 11 (which gives joy during the range [1,5][1,5]), and task 22 (which gives joy during the range [3,9][3,9]). It can be proven that Egor cannot acquire joy from all 33 tasks at the same time, so 22 is the maximum joyfulness Egor can wake up to.
Test case 22: We can use techniques 1515, 2222, and 3232 to wake up at minute 15+22+32=6915+22+32=69. At that time. there are 22 tasks that give Egor joy: task 11 and task 33.
Test case 33: The maximum minute we can wake up to is 1+2+⋯+9=451+2+⋯+9=45, which means we cannot acquire joy from any task.
