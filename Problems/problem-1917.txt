Chef has a string SS with length NN. He also has MM other strings P1,P2,…,PMP1,P2,…,PM, which are called patterns. The characters in the strings are indexed from 11.
Chef was wondering if he could find the MM patterns in the string SS in the given order. That is, he wanted to know whether it is possible to choose MM ranges, denoted by [li,ri][li,ri] for each ii (1≤i≤M1≤i≤M), such that 1≤l1≤r1<l2≤r2<…<lM≤rM≤N1≤l1≤r1<l2≤r2<…<lM≤rM≤N and for each valid ii, the substring Sli,Sli+1,…,SriSli,Sli+1,…,Sri equals PiPi.
As this problem was too easy for Chef, he decided to make a harder one. A permutation p=(p1,p2,…,pM)p=(p1,p2,…,pM) of integers 11 through MM is called a matchable permutation if Chef can reorder the MM patterns into Pp1,Pp2,…,PpMPp1,Pp2,…,PpM and then find them in SS, in this order (in the same way as described above).
Can you help Chef find the number of matchable permutations?
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.
The second line contains a single string SS.
MM lines follow. For each ii (1≤i≤M)1≤i≤M), the ii-th of these lines contains a single string PiPi. 

Output
Print a single line containing one integer - the number of matchable permutations.

abbabacbac
ab
ac
b

Example Output 1
3

Explanation 1
Among the 3!=63!=6 possible permutations of (1,2,3)(1,2,3), the matchable permutations are (1,2,3)(1,2,3), (3,1,2)(3,1,2) and (1,3,2)(1,3,2). These correspond to permutations of patterns ("ab", "ac", "b"), ("b", "ab", "ac") and ("ab", "b", "ac") respectively. Each of them can be found in SS in the given order.
Example Input 2
3 2
aaa
aa
aa

Example Output 2
0

Explanation 2
We cannot match the two patterns in such a way that their ranges do not intersect.
Example Input 3
4 2
aaaa
aa
aa

Example Output 3
2

Explanation 3
The matchable permutations are (1,2)(1,2) and (2,1)(2,1).
