You are given an array AA of length NN, which initially is a permutation of integers from 11 to N.
We want to make the array empty by performing the following operation N times: choose any index i and remove Ai from A, which decrements the size of A by 1. 
We will perform exactly N such operations. Apparently, there are N! ways to do this. But now we wonder how many ways satisfy that, during the process, the array doesn't contain any consecutive monotone triples? 
A consecutive monotone triple is a tuple of consecutive elements (i,i+1,i+2)
which satisfy
Ai<Ai+1<Ai+2 or Ai>Ai+1>Ai+2.
Since the answer may be large, print it modulo 109+7.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T − the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains the single integer N.
The second line of each testcases contains n integers A1,A2,…,AN − the initial array A.
Output Format
For each test case print a single integer − the answer modulo 109+7.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
3≤N≤200000
1≤Ai≤N
The sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 200000.
Ai≠Aj for i≠j
Initially A doesn't contain consecutive monotone triples.

Subtasks
Subtask 1 (50 points): The sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 5000.
Subtask 2 (50 points): No additional constraints.

Explanation
In the second testcase, an example of a valid deletion is [1,4,2,3]→[1,4,3]→[1,3]→[1].
Meanwhile [1,4,2,3]→[1,2,3]→[1,3]→[1] is not a valid deletion since [1,2,3] contains a consectutive monoton triple.
