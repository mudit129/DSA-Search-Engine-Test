You are given a string SS with length NN. Determine if it is possible to find two non-empty strings AA and BB which satisfy the following conditions:

A+B=SA+B=S, where ++ denotes string concatenation
BB is a substring of AA

Note: BB is a substring of AA if BB can be obtained from AA by deleting several (possibly zero) characters from the beginning and several (possibly zero) characters from the end. For example, "ab" is a substring of "cabd", but "ad" is not.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains a single string SS.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to find strings AA and BB satisfying the given conditions or "NO" otherwise (without quotes).
Constraints

1≤T≤1041≤T≤104
2≤N≤1052≤N≤105
|S|=N|S|=N
SS contains only lowercase English letters
the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 106106

NO
YES
NO
YES
Explanation
Example case 1: We can choose "cabd" as AA and "ab" as BB. We can see that A+B=SA+B=S and BB is a substring of AA.
Example case 2: It is impossible to find two strings which satisfy the constraints. For example, when AA is "yourcrushlovesyou" and BB is "back", then A+B=SA+B=S, but BB is not a substring of AA.
Example case 3: We can choose "wubbalubbadub" as AA and "dub" as BB.
