You are given an array AA of nn integers as input. Also, you are given an integer qq, the number of queries. In each query, you will be given an integer xx, and you have to output the number of sub-arrays of AA, having sum, exactly equal to xx.
Input:

First line will contain nn, the number of elements of array.
Second line will contain array AA of nn integers.
Third line will contain an integer, qq.
Next qq lines will contain an integer, xx.

Output:
For each of the qq queries, output the number of sub-arrays of AA, having sum exactly equal to xx.
Constraints:

1≤n≤1001≤n≤100
0≤A[i]≤1000≤A[i]≤100
1≤q≤1051≤q≤105
−1000000000≤x≤1000000000−1000000000≤x≤1000000000

Sample Input:
4
2 3 0 2
2
10
5

Sample Output:
0
3

Explanation:

For query−1query−1, we don't have any sub-array of AA, with sum=10sum=10. So, the answer for this query is 00.
For query−2query−2, we have three sub-arrays of AA (sub−array[1,..,3]sub−array[1,..,3], sub−array[1,..,2]sub−array[1,..,2] & sub−array[2,..,4]sub−array[2,..,4]), with sum=5sum=5. So, the answer for this query is 33.
