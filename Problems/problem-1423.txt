Omi loves to play with Segment Trees. Now, Govi wants to test his knowledge about segment trees. He gave him a array of length NN, where each element of the array is from 11 to KK ( both inclusive ) . He asked him QQ queries of two types :

Type 1 :  1 uu vv -> Update the value at position uu to vv.
Type 2 :  2 -> Find the length of the shortest contiguous subarray which contain all the integers from 11 to KK.

Input:

The first line contains three space-separated integers NN, KK and QQ
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
Next QQ lines contain two types of queries-> 
1 u v OROR 2

Output:
For each query of type 22, output in a single line answer given by Omi, if no subarray exist print −1−1.
Constraints

1≤N≤1051≤N≤105
1≤K≤501≤K≤50
1≤Q≤1051≤Q≤105
1≤A[i]≤K1≤A[i]≤K

  1 3 2 1 2 3    
  1 1 2

  1 4 3
  2

Sample Output:
3

-1
EXPLANATION:

After First Query, array becomes : [2,3,2,1,2,3][2,3,2,1,2,3]
Output for Second Query = 3
After third query, array becomes : [2,3,2,3,2,3][2,3,2,3,2,3]
Output for the  Fourth Query = -1 (No contiguous subarray that contains all the integers from 11 to KK)
