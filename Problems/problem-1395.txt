For the registration of Ojass'18 students of NIT Jsr prefer to go in a group of friends to the registration room. Oraganising members of the Ojass want to increase the number of registration as much as possible.
There are N groups in total. You are given the in time, I  and out time, O of all the groups with their group size S. In a certain time range l to r, organising members of Ojass want to know the maximum numbers of students. They repeat this query Q number of times. As you are a good coder, they want to take your help.
Input:
First line contains N and Q, the number of groups came for registration and Q queries. Then N lines follows:
Each line conatins three integers, I,O and S, intime, outtime and size of the group.
Then follows Q lines each of which containing two integers l and r.
Output:
Print Q lines each of which is the maximum number of students in the room between time l to r.
Contraints:
1 ≤ N,Q ≤ 100000
1 ≤ I ≤ O ≤ 10^18
1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18
1 ≤ S ≤ 100000
Sample Input:
3 2
2 4 3
3 8 4
5 7 5
4 7
2 4
Sample Output:
9
7
 
Explanation
Total number of students between time 1 to 8 is {0,3,7,7,9,9,9,4}, so maximum number of students in time range 4 to 7 is 9 and maximum number of students in time range 2 to 4 is 7
