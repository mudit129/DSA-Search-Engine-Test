You are given a string SS. A cyclic shift of SS is a string formed by moving a number of characters from the beginning of SS to its end (in the same order). Formally, for an integer kk (0≤k<N0≤k<N), the kk-th cyclic shift is a string RR with length NN such that:

Ri=Si+kRi=Si+k for each 1≤i≤N−k1≤i≤N−k
Ri=Si−N+kRi=Si−N+k for each N−k+1≤i≤NN−k+1≤i≤N

A string is palindromic if it is equal to its own reverse string.
Compute the number of palindromic cyclic shifts of the given string.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single string SS.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of palindromic shifts.
