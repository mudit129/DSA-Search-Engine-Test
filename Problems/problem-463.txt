You are provided four points pp on xx-axis, qq on yy-axis, rr(min - value on xx-axis) and ss(min - value on yy-axis). Initially, p≥rp≥r and q≥sq≥s. You can perform the following operation less than or equal to n times:
Select either pp or qq and reduce it by 11. Where point pp cannot become less than rr, and point qq cannot become less than ss.
Find the minimum possible area under p,q(p⋅q)p,q(p⋅q) you can cover by applying the given operation less than or equal to nn times.
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
The only line of the test case contains 55 integer points p,q,r,sp,q,r,s and nn.

Output:

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum possible area under pp and q(p⋅q)q(p⋅q) you can cover by applying the given operation less than or equal to nn times.

Constraints

1≤T≤2⋅1041≤T≤2⋅104
1≤p,q,r,s,n≤1091≤p,q,r,s,n≤109

Sample Input:
    4
    10 11 2 1 5
    10 10 8 5 3
    12 8 8 7 2
    10 11 9 1 10

Sample Output:
    55
    70
    77
    10

EXPLANATION:

In the first test case, if you reduce pp five times then only obtain 5⋅11=555⋅11=55.
In the second test case, if you reduce qq three times then only obtain 10⋅7=7010⋅7=70.
In the third test case, if you reduce bb one time and qq one time then only obtain 11⋅7=7711⋅7=77.
In the fourth test case, if you reduce q ten times then only obtain 10⋅1=1010⋅1=10.
