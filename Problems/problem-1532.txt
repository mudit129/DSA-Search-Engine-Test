Chef has two binary strings AA and BB, each of length NN.  He can perform the following operation on AA any number of times:

Choose LL and RR (1≤L≤R≤N)(1≤L≤R≤N), such that, in the substring A[L,R]A[L,R], the number of 11s is not equal to the number of 00s and reverse the substring A[L,R]A[L,R].

Find whether Chef can convert the string AA into the string BB by performing the above operation any (possibly zero) number of times on AA.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT, the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains one integer NN, the length of the binary strings.
The second line of each test case contains the string AA.
The third line of each test case contains the string BB.

Output Format
For each test case, print YESYES if it is possible to convert the string AA into the string BB by performing any (possibly zero) number of given operations on AA. Otherwise, print NONO.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YeSYeS, yEsyEs, yesyes and YESYES will all be treated as identical).
Constraints

Explanation
Test Case 11: It is impossible to convert 1111 to 0000 by performing any number of operations.
Test Case 22: We can convert the string AA into string BB as:

Operation 11: Choose L=2L=2 and R=4R=4. Hence, the chosen substring is 1011––––01011_0. On reversing this substring, we get 1110011100. 
Operation 22: Choose L=3L=3 and R=5R=5. Hence, the chosen substring is 11100––––11100_. On reversing it, we get 1100111001.

Note that the number of 11s is not equal to the number of 00s in the chosen substrings.
Test Case 33: It is impossible to convert 1010 to 0101 by performing any number of operations.
