Chef had a sequence S0,S1,…,SN−1S0,S1,…,SN−1; each element of this sequence was an integer between 00 and N−1N−1 (inclusive). Unfortunately, he forgot some (possibly zero or all) elements of this sequence. You are given a sequence A0,A1,…,AN−1A0,A1,…,AN−1, where for each valid ii, Ai=−1Ai=−1 denotes an element Chef forgot and if Ai≠−1Ai≠−1, then Ai=SiAi=Si.
Before Chef forgot any elements of SS, he created a sequence B0,B1,…,BN−1B0,B1,…,BN−1, where for each valid ii, BiBi is the number of occurrences of the value ii in SS (the number of valid indices jj such that Sj=iSj=i), and then, he created a third sequence G0,G1,…,GNG0,G1,…,GN, where for each valid ii, GiGi is the number of occurrences of the value ii in BB. (Note that the elements of BB are between 00 and NN inclusive.) Unfortunately, Chef also forgot the sequence BB, but he remembers GG.
Help Chef restore the missing elements of the sequence SS. Precisely, find the lexicographically smallest sequence SS which is consistent with all the given information or determine that there is no such sequence.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A0,A1,…,AN−1A0,A1,…,AN−1.
The third line contains N+1N+1 space-separated integers G0,G1,…,GNG0,G1,…,GN.

Output
For each test case:

If there is no sequence SS consistent with all the given information, print a single line containing the string "impossible".
Otherwise, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers S0,S1,…,SN−1S0,S1,…,SN−1 - the lexicographically smallest valid sequence SS.
