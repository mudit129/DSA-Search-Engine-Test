Professor GukiZ decided to distribute all of his candies to his NN students (numbered 11 through NN). Let's denote the number of candies GukiZ gave to the ii-th student by pipi. As GukiZ has a lot of students, he does not remember all the exact numbers of candies he gave to the students. He only remembers the following properties of the sequence pp:

The numbers of candies given to each of the first KK students (p1,p2,…,pKp1,p2,…,pK) are known exactly.
All elements of the sequence pp are distinct.
The difference between the maximum and minimum element of the sequence pp does not exceed xx.
The professor gave out the biggest possible total number of candies, i.e. S=p1+p2+p3+…+pNS=p1+p2+p3+…+pN is maximum possible.

Normally, professors never lie, so the information provided by GukiZ is valid and there is at least one sequence that satisfies all conditions. GukiZ would like to know the total number of candies SS he had at the beginning. Can you help him find this number?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, KK and xx.
The second line contains KK space-separated integers p1,p2,…,pKp1,p2,…,pK.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of candies GukiZ had.

Explanation
Example case 1: There are four students. We know that the first student got p1=2p1=2 candies, the second student got p2=1p2=1 and the third got p3=5p3=5 candies; we don't know the number of candies given to the last student. The difference between the maximum and minimum number of candies given to students is already 5−1=4=x5−1=4=x, so the fourth student could only have been given between 11 and 55 candies. It can't be 55 either, so we maximize the number of candies if we give 44 candies to the fourth student. In total, there are 2+1+5+4=122+1+5+4=12 candies.
Example case 2: We know the number of candies given to each of the two students, so we know that GukiZ had 3+6=93+6=9 candies.
