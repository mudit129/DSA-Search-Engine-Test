Chef wants to teach a lesson of sharing to the students.
There are NN students (numbered from 11 to NN from left to right) who are asked to stand in a row. Initially Chef gave AAii candies to the iithth child. In one operation any child can give any number of candies to the child standing to his immediate left (i.e. iithth child can give any amount of candies to the (i−1)(i−1)thth child. In particular 1st child cannot give his candies to anyone).  
He asked them to minimize the maximum value of candies a student can possess after performing any number of operations (possibly zero). 
Help the students finding such maximum value.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
First line of each test case contains a single integer NN denoting the number of students.
Second line contains NN space-separated integers AA11,AA22,.......... AANN denoting the initial amount of candies chef gave to them.

Output:

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― maximum value after sharing.

Constraints

1≤T≤1001≤T≤100
1≤N≤1051≤N≤105
00 ≤≤ AAii ≤≤ 109109
Sum of NN over all Test Cases does not exceed 105105

Explanation

For First Test Case:
The 55thth student will give 22 candies to 44thth student and 44thth will give 33 candies to 33rdrd and 33rdrd will give 33 candies to 22ndnd and 22ndnd will give 22 candies to 11stst. So finally the number of candies that they will have are 
[3,3,3,3,3][3,3,3,3,3] and the value of maximum candies is 33.
For Second Test Case:
Sharing to the left student will not change the maximum value as 11stst cannot share to anyone. So the maximum value will remain 55.
