RiggiRiggi   is a spy of KBIKBI and he is on a secret mission, he is spying an Underworld Don  AnitAnit.
RiggiRiggi  is spying him since 5 years and he is not able to find  any evidence against AnitAnit. 
KBIKBI told RiggiRiggi they will send him a code string in a special format that will inform him whether he  has continue or return back from mission.
According to KBIKBI  firstly  he  has to find what is the original string and then he has to check string is palindrome or not .
If its a palindrome then he has to leave the mission and return back else continue spying AnitAnit. 
Rules to find original string :
1:-If in Code string any integer(N) followed by a string of alphabets that starts with '+' and  ends with '-' then he has to repeat that string N times  , like 3+acg- = acgacgacg.
2:-If there is no integer present before string then print the string is repeated 1 time.
    like bc=bc.
Example of conversion from  Code string  to original string  : 2+ac-3+kb-j=acackbkbkbj  
Input:

Code string SS is taken as input  .

Output:

Print  string ContinueContinue if code string SS is not a palindrome else print ReturnReturn .

Constraints

1≤S≤10001≤S≤1000
1≤N≤10001≤N≤1000

Sample Input 1:
3+xy-bb3+yx-

Sample Output 1:
Return

Sample Input 2:
3+xy-bb3+xy-

Sample Output 2:
Continue

EXPLANATION:
Sample 1:- original string will be xyxyxybbyxyxyx which is  a palindrome hence print ReturnReturn.
 Sample 2:- original string will be xyxyxybbxyxyxy which is not a palindrome hence print 
                     ContinueContinue.
