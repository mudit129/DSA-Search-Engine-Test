In Chefland, there are MM types of cookies, numbered 11 through MM. There is an infinite supply of cookies of each type. 
Each morning, the Master Chef of Chefland prepares a menu — a sequence of cookies. There may be multiple cookies with identical types in a menu. Two menus are considered different if the total number of cookies in one menu is different from their total number in the other menu or there is a valid index xx such that the type of the xx-th cookie in one menu is different from the type of the xx-th cookie in the other menu. For example, menus (1,2,1)(1,2,1), (1,2,1,2)(1,2,1,2) are different, and (1,1,2,3)(1,1,2,3), (1,2,1,3)(1,2,1,3) are also different.
To make things interesting, each morning, Master Chef receives three integers LL, RR and KK. To prepare a menu on that morning, he may use a cookie of type xx only if L≤x≤RL≤x≤R and he may not use more than KK cookies in total in this menu. For example, when L=3L=3, R=5R=5 and K=4K=4, then (5,4,3,5)(5,4,3,5) and (3,5,5)(3,5,5) are possible menus, while (5,4,3,5,4)(5,4,3,5,4) and (3,5,6)(3,5,6) are not.
Moreover, a menu becomes special only if there is no integer x>1x>1 that divides the type of each cookie in the menu, i.e. a menu S=(s1,s2,…,sn)S=(s1,s2,…,sn) is special if gcd(s1,s2,…,sn)=1gcd(s1,s2,…,sn)=1.
You should process QQ queries. In each query, you are given the parameters LL, RR and KK for one morning. Master Chef wonders how many different special menus are possible. Can you help him calculate the number of possible special menus on each morning modulo 230230?
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers MM and QQ.
Each of the next QQ lines contains three space-separated integers LL, RR and KK describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the number of possible special menus modulo 230230.
