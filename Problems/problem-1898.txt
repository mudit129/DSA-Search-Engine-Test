You are given a grid with NN rows and MM columns, where each cell contains either '0' or '1'.
You may perform the following operation up to KK times: choose two different cells and swap the values in them. Find the largest possible side length of a square subgrid which contains only '0'-s after performing these operations.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT, total number of testcases.
Each testcase contains N+1N+1 lines of input.
The first line contains three space-separated integers NN, MM and KK.
NN lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains a single string with length MM describing the ii-th row of the grid.

Output
For each testcase, print a single line containing one integer ― the largest side length of a square subgrid containing only '0'-s.

Explanation
Case 1: Since all the '0'-s in the grid already form a square with side length 33, no swaps are required.
Case 2: If we could swap the values in pairs of cells (0,1)(0,1), (0,6)(0,6) and (2,1)(2,1), (2,4)(2,4), we would get a square with side length 33 using 22 swaps. But since the maximum possible number of swaps is 11, the answer cannot be greater than 22.
Case 3: We can swap the values in pairs of cells (0,1)(0,1), (0,6)(0,6) and (2,1)(2,1), (2,4)(2,4). Then, we get a square with side length 33 using 22 swaps.
