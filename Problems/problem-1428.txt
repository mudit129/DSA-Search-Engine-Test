Mei Mei, being the diva she is, loves to dance. She wants to woo Po and thus decides to buy a dress as colourful as possible. But in order to get the most colourful dress, she has to solve a problem.
She has an array of NN elements A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. Each element of the array is between 11 and NN(both inclusive). The value at any index is called the intensity of that index. The power of an array is defined as the sum of all the intensities in the array.
Her task is to make the power of the array to be KK and for that, you have to choose any one subarray and change the intensities of maximum XX indices in that subarray. The changed intensity should lie between 11 and NN(both inclusive). But there's one more constraint, the length of the chosen subarray should be the minimum.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, XX, and KK.  
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN representing the intensities of each index.

Output:
Output the minimum length of subarray possible, or −1−1 if an array of power KK cannot be achieved by changing at most XX intensities.
