Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum are playing a fierce match of binary Nim. This novel game is played with NN stacks, each of them containing only 11-s and 00-s.
Just like in normal Nim, Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum alternate turns; in their turn, a player must choose one non-empty stack and remove a positive number of elements from the top of this stack. However, Tweedle-Dee may only choose a stack with 00 at the top (and remove elements from it afterwards), and similarly, Tweedle-Dum may only choose a stack with 11 at the top. the player that cannot make a move loses
Suzumo does not want to wait for the end of the game, so given the starting player he asks you to determine the winner. Remember that Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum are legendary grandmasters of combinatorial games, so both always play optimally.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN, a string SS denoting the number of stacks, the player that starts the game, respectively.
Each of the following NN lines contains a single binary string BB representing a stack; the first character of BB corresponds to the top element of the stack and the last character to the bottom element.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Dee" if Tweedle-Dee wins the match or "Dum" if Tweedle-Dum wins.
