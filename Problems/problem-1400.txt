Today, Fluffy decided to play with a sequence of integers, a1a1, a2a2, ……, anan which is coincidentally a permutation of the numbers 11, 22, ……, nn. Fluffy thinks that a sequence b1b1, b2b2, ……, bkbk is alternating if and only if either of the following holds :

For all ii, bi<bi+1bi<bi+1 if and only if ii is odd
For all ii, bi<bi+1bi<bi+1 if and only if ii is even

For example, 11,44,22,55,33 and 44,11,55,22,33 are both alternating sequences.
A subsequence of a sequence is a sequence that is formed by deleting zero or more elements of the original sequence. For example, 33, 44, 55 is a subsequence of 11, 33, 22, 44, 77, 66, 55. 
Flippy the bird has asked Fluffy to find the longest alternating subsequence of the array aa, but there are so many of them, so he also wants to know the number of longest alternating subsequences. Can you help him?
Input

The first line contains a single integer nn, the length of the sequence.
The next line contains nn space-separated integers, a1a1, a2a2, ……, anan. It is guaranteed that these numbers are a permutation of 11, 22, ……, nn.

Output
Output two space-separated integers, the length of the longest alternating subsequences and the number of longest alternating subsequences. Since there might be many longest alternating subsequences, output the number of alternating subsequences modulo 109+7109+7
