Firdavs is living on planet F. There are NN cities (numbered 11 through NN) on this planet; let's denote the value of city ii by vivi. Firdavs can travel directly from each city to any other city. When he travels directly from city xx to city yy, he needs to pay f(x,y)=|vy−vx|+y−xf(x,y)=|vy−vx|+y−x coins (this number can be negative, in which case he receives −f(x,y)−f(x,y) coins).
Let's define a simple path from city xx to city yy with length k≥1k≥1 as a sequence of cities a1,a2,…,aka1,a2,…,ak such that all cities in this sequence are different, a1=xa1=x and ak=yak=y. The cost of such a path is ∑k−1i=1f(ai,ai+1)∑i=1k−1f(ai,ai+1).
You need to answer some queries for Firdavs. In each query, you are given two cities xx and yy, and you need to find the minimum cost of a simple path from city xx to city yy. Then, you need to find the length of the longest simple path from xx to yy with this cost.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers v1,v2,…,vNv1,v2,…,vN.
The following QQ lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers xx and yy.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing two space-separated integers ― the minimum cost and the maximum length.

Explanation
Example case 1: For the first query, there are two paths with cost 44 from city 22 to city 33:

2→1→32→1→3: cost (|4−2|+1−2)+(|5−4|+3−1)=4(|4−2|+1−2)+(|5−4|+3−1)=4, length 33
2→32→3: cost |5−2|+3−2=4|5−2|+3−2=4, length 22

All other paths have greater costs, so the minimum cost is 44. Among these two paths, we want the one with greater length, which is 33.
