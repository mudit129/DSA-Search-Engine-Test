Young Luffy is on a quest to become the King Of The Pirates. For that to happen he has to choose two comrades who will help him accomplish this goal. He has a group of N battle-hardened pirates to choose from. All the N pirates can be represented as a hierarchy of rooted tree where pirate 1 is the boss of all pirates. You are also given the Battle power of all the pirates in form of an array. The Nakama power of a pirate is defined as the sum of all Nakama power of the people included in his subtree plus his own battle power.
In short the Nakama power of any leaf node pirate is equal to his battle power.
The attitude ratio between any two pirates is defined as the absolute difference between their Nakama power. Your task is to help Luffy choose two comrades from the list of N pirates such that the attitude ratio between them is minimum possible.
Input:

First line of input contains NN the number of pirates.
Next N−1N−1 lines of input contain 2 space-separated integers xx, yy, where pirate xx and yy have a bi-directional relation between them.
Next line of input contains NN space-separated integers such that B[i]B[i] is the Battle power of ithith pirate.

Output:
It should contain a single integer denoting the minimum attitude ratio between any two pirates.

EXPLANATION:
The tree can be represented as:

The Nakama power of each pirates are 
Na[3]=B[3]=8Na[3]=B[3]=8 It is a leaf node so its Nakama power is equal to its Battle power.
Na[4]=B[4]=10Na[4]=B[4]=10 It is a leaf node so its Nakama power is equal to its Battle power.
Na[5]=B[5]=2Na[5]=B[5]=2 It is a leaf node so its Nakama power is equal to its Battle power.
Na[7]=B[7]=7Na[7]=B[7]=7 It is a leaf node so its Nakama power is equal to its Battle power.
Na[8]=B[8]=11Na[8]=B[8]=11 It is a leaf node so its Nakama power is equal to its Battle power.
Na[2]=B[2]+Na[5]+Na[7]+Na[8]=25Na[2]=B[2]+Na[5]+Na[7]+Na[8]=25 It will be the sum of all nodes in its subtree as well its own battle power.
Na[6]=B[6]+Na[2]+Na[3]+Na[5]+Na[7]+Na[8]=39Na[6]=B[6]+Na[2]+Na[3]+Na[5]+Na[7]+Na[8]=39 It will be the sum of all nodes in its subtree as well its own battle power.
Na[1]=B[1]+Na[2]+Na[3]+Na[4]+Na[5]+Na[7]+Na[8]=52Na[1]=B[1]+Na[2]+Na[3]+Na[4]+Na[5]+Na[7]+Na[8]=52 It will be the sum of all nodes in its subtree as well its own battle power.
As you can see Node 4 and 8 have a minimum difference of 1.
So the output is 1.
