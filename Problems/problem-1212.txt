This is an interactive problem (as always).
Alice and Bob were getting bored and decided to play a game with keyboards. The configuration of the keyboard is:

The keyboard consists of 3636 keys arranged in 33 rows having 1313, 1212 and 1111 keys respectively. 
Each key has dimensions 2×22×2 and there is no space between any two adjacent keys. 
The ithith key of the first row is 11 unit to the left of the ithith key of the second row and similarly for the keys of the second and the third row. 
Each key corresponds to either a Lowercase English Alphabet or a Numeric Digit.
No two keys correspond to the same character. The order in which the characters are distributed among the keys is not fixed.

For example, the keyboard may look as follows:

The time required by Bob to move his fingers between two keys is equal to the Manhattan distance between their centers.
The time required by him to type a word is equal to the total time required by him to move his fingers between the keys corresponding to the consecutive characters of the word.  
For example, if the characters are arranged in way shown in the image above, the time required by Bob to type the word adh0cadh0c will be equal to 4+8+13+8=334+8+13+8=33.  
Alice doesn't know which key corresponds to which character and her task is to guess it. For this, Bob is willing to answer at most 180180 queries of Type 11 and at most 11 query of Type 22 as described below -

Type 11: Alice will provide a word of length at least 22 and at most 3636 to Bob. Bob will respond with the time taken by him to type the word.
Type 22: Alice will provide a single character to Bob. Bob will respond with the location of the key which corresponds to this character.

Alice and Bob will play this game TT times with different keyboards. Play as Alice and win the games.
Interaction
First read a single line containing a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases.
For each test case, you may ask up to 180180 queries of Type 11 and up to 11 query of Type 22. 

To ask a query of Type 11, print ? s? s where ss is the word you want to query satisfying 2≤|s|≤362≤|s|≤36. Then, read a single integer denoting the time taken by Bob to type this word.
To ask a query of Type 22, print ? c? c where cc is the character you want to query. Then, read two integers XX and YY denoting that the YthYth key of the XthXth row corresponds to this character.

Once you know the configuration of the keyboard, print a single line containing the character !! followed by three lines containing strings of length 1313, 1212 and 1111 respectively denoting the characters in the first, second and third row respectively. Then, you must continue solving the remaining test cases.  
If you exceed 180180 queries of Type 11 or 11 query of Type 22 or ask an invalid query, the judge will give you Wrong AnswerWrong Answer verdict and stop the interaction. Make sure to terminate your program in such cases.
Also, make sure to strictly follow the interaction format and flush your output after printing each line otherwise you may get unexpected verdicts like Judge ErrorJudge Error.  
Note that some of the testcases use an adaptive judge while some use a non-adaptive judge. So, the hidden configuration might change depending on your queries.
Scoring
The score you will get, depends on the number of Type 11 queries you ask in the worst case. There are 2020 test files each containing multiple test cases. Let QQ denote the maximum number of Type 11 queries asked over all test cases over all test files.
If you get a non-AC verdict for any of the test files, you will get 00 points. Otherwise, the number of points you will get is given by: 
P=100×3−max(0,Q−60)24P=100×3−max(0,Q−60)24
In other words,

If Q≤60Q≤60, you will get 100100 points.
If Q=180Q=180, you will get around 0.410.41 points. 
For every 2424 queries asked, your points will be reduced to one-third.

Explanation
Let d(c1,c2)d(c1,c2) denote the distance between the keys corresponding to the characters c1c1 and c2c2.
For the sample test case, the hidden keyboard configuration is the one given in the problem statement.  

The first query is a Type 11 query. The time required to type the word codechefcodechef is equal to d(c,o)+d(o,d)+d(d,e)+d(e,c)+d(c,h)+d(h,e)+d(e,f)d(c,o)+d(o,d)+d(d,e)+d(e,c)+d(c,h)+d(h,e)+d(e,f) =18+17+3+6+9+11+5=69=18+17+3+6+9+11+5=69 
The second query is also a Type 11 query and the time required to type the word jay1048576jay1048576 is equal to 14+13+2+8+11+3+11+15+6=8314+13+2+8+11+3+11+15+6=83.  
The third query is a Type 22 query. The 9th9th key of the 3rd3rd row corresponds to the character nn. So, the judge returns 3 93 9.  
The fourth query is a Type 11 query. The time required to type the word adh0cadh0c is equal to 3333 as mentioned in the problem statement.
