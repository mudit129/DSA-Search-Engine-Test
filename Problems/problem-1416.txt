Ed, Edd, and Eddy have abducted Plank, Johnny’s best friend (who is actually a piece of wood). Eddy demands money for returning Plank but since Johnny had no money, Edd being the smarter one decided to let go of Plank if he could answer all their questions. 
Edd gives a tree with nn nodes and each node has a value aiai associated with it, they give him qq queries. Each of them asks a particular type of query as given below:
1 x val, Update ithith node in subtree of x to (aiai XOR val)
2 x, Print the bitwise AND of all distinct nodes pairs of bitwise OR of aiai in subtree of x i.e. &(aiai | ajaj) i≠ji≠j i,ji,j belongs to subtree of x.
3 x, Print the bitwise OR of all distinct nodes pairs of bitwise AND of aiai in subtree of x i.e. |(aiai & ajaj) i≠ji≠j i,ji,j belongs to subtree of x.  
Note: The tree is rooted at 1.
Note: If there is only one node in the subtree then answer is zero for query 2 and 3.
Input:

First-line contains n,qn,q, number of vertices and queries to be answered.
Each of the next N−1N−1  lines describes the edges of the tree. Each line contains 2 space-separated integers A and B, meaning that there is an edge between nodes A and B.  
The next line contains n spaced separated integers corresponding to all nodes i.e. aiai.
Each of the q lines contains any of the three types as described above.

Output:
Print answers to the query of type 2 and 3 in the new-line.
