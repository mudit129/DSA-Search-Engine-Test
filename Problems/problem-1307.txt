There are two Kingdoms, Kingdom 11 and Kingdom 22 who always battle among them.
Kingdom 11 has army of size NN and kingdom 22 has army of size MM.

The war is going to last for  QQ days.
Each soldier in kingdom 11 or kingdom 22 has some initial positive integer value ViVi, representing the Strength of soldier ( 11 <= ii <= NN for soldier of Kingdom1 and 11<= ii <=MM for soldier of Kingdom2).
On each day ii, Kingdom 11 will send a battalion of the army from  index aiai to bibi and Kingdom 22 will send a battalion from index cici to didi .
You are also given the results of QiQith day( i.e which kingdom won on QithQith day). The battalion of the winning kingdom who fought on the Qith day gets their Strength increased by their initial values (given in input)  and that of losing kingdom gets their Strength decreased by  their initial values (given in input).
The king of Winning kingdom will reward a random soldier of their army , but to reward him he has to say his current strength out loud !!! , but unfortunately they only remember their initial Strength value so they ask you to remember their  current Strength.
 You are  asked the current strength of a particular soldier of winning kingdom  on that day.
You have to print output for each day.
Input:

First line will contain Three space separated integers N,M,QN,M,Q 
The Second line will contains NN space separated integers ,which are initial Strengths of soldiers of Kingdom 1.
The Third  line will contains MM space separated integers ,which are the initial Strengths of soldiers of Kingdom 2.
Next QQ lines will contain 66 space separated integers aiai ,bibi , cici ,didi, KK , PosPos . 

KK represents which Kingdom won on the ithith day.It can be 11 representing Kingdom 11 and 22 representing Kingdom 22.You have to print the strength of the soldier of winning kingdom whose index is PosPos.  If KK=11,PosPos is between 11 to NN,else PosPos is between 11 to MM.
Output:
Print the result of each day i.e the current value of strength of soldier whose index is PosPos belonging to winning Kingdom's Battalion.

EXPLANATION:
-Day 1: Kingdom 2 won ,So soldiers indexing from 1 to 1 of Kingdom 2 increase their Strength by their initial value  i.e 1 and soldiers indexing from 1 to 2 of Kingdom 1 decrease their Strength by 2,4 respectively. 
Current Value of strength of soldier whose index is 1 of Kingdom 2 is 1+1=2.
So, After  day 1 values of Strengths of soldiers of Kingdom 1:[0,0, 3] and that of Kingdom 2 :
[2, 5,4].
-Day 2: Kingdom 1 won ,So soldiers indexing from 1 to 3 of Kingdom 1 increase their Strength by their initial value  i.e 2,4,3 respectively and soldiers indexing from 2 to 3 of Kingdom 2 decrease their Strength by 5,4 respectively. 
Current Value of strength of soldier whose index is 2 of Kingdom 1 is 0+4=4.
-So,After Day 2 values of Strengths of soldiers of Kingdom 1:[2, 4, 6] and that of Kingdom 2 :
[2, 0, 0].
