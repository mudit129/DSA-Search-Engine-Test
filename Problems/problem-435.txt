Let S(N)S(N) denote the sum of digits of a positive integer NN. You are given three positive integers XX, YY and ZZ. Consider all triples of positive integers (A,B,C)(A,B,C) such that:

S(A+B)=XS(A+B)=X
S(B+C)=YS(B+C)=Y
S(C+A)=ZS(C+A)=Z

Your task is to find the triple which maximises S(A+B+C)S(A+B+C) and the triple which minimises S(A+B+C)S(A+B+C). Specifically, you are given an additional integer PP with the following meaning:

If P=0P=0, find the maximum value of S(A+B+C)S(A+B+C) and one triple (A,B,C)(A,B,C) corresponding to this maximum value.
If P=1P=1, find the minimum value of S(A+B+C)S(A+B+C) and one triple (A,B,C)(A,B,C) corresponding to this minimum value.

If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers XX, YY, ZZ and PP.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing four space-separated integers — the minimum or maximum value of SS and the corresponding values of AA, BB and CC.
AA, BB and CC should be printed without leading zeros. The number of digits in each of AA, BB and CC should not exceed 5⋅1055⋅105. The total number of digits in the integers AA, BB and CC in all test cases should not exceed 107107.
