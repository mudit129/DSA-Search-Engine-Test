Chef is writing some arbitrary strings as he is getting bored. After writing some strings , he thinks that his arrangement of letters is very dirty. Then he is struck by an idea that he can play a game with those arbitrary strings .
NOTE:NOTE:
Strings are in form aabbbccdeefffff….. and so on. once the repetition of a letter is over , it can't be repeated again . ( abbcddddeefffabbcddddeefff (valid)(valid) ,    aabbbccbddaabbbccbdd  ( invalidinvalid, asas bb isis repeatedrepeated againagain eveneven afterafter itsits repetitionrepetition isis overover))
He takes a string SS and then decides to modify the string such that it should contain all the letters present in it in ascending order of their repetitions. To do that he starts swapping the groups of letters . ( swaps whole ′aa′′aa′ with ′ccc′′ccc′ , swaps whole ′ddd′′ddd′ with ′ffff′′ffff′ , etc) and cost of swap is difference in the frequencies of the letters getting swapped . FrequencyFrequency ofof aa letterletter isis thethe numbernumber ofof timestimes thethe letterletter isis repeatedrepeated inin thethe string.string.

Find the minimum cost to attain such a string .
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, the string SS. 

Output:
For each testcase, output a single line which gives minimum cost to attain the desired string.

EXPLANATION:
Case−1Case−1 :  First swap 'd' with 'aa'( 2-1=1) and 'e' with 'bb' (2-1=1 ) , then swap 'ii' with 'ccc'( 3-2=1) , then 'ccc' with 'ffff' ( 4-3=1  )  , then 'ffff' with 'hhhhh' ( 5-4=1 ) . Thus total cost will  be 1+1+1+1+1 =5 and the final string would be deiiaabbcccgggffffhhhhhdeiiaabbcccgggffffhhhhh .
