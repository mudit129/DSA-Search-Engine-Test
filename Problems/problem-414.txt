With this jump, you move further in time and land inside the NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration]. The ways of time are completely bizarre. You hear the same laugh which pushed you in this machine and you turn to find the mad scientist, Prof Paradox. He laughs telling you that you have entered doomsday and that the whole Homosapien species ends that day. Though shocked you are determined to stop this, whatever it might be.
Prof Paradox is a part of the Asteroid Impact Avoidance Committee [AIAC] in NASA and he informs you that NN asteroids, with varying sizes, are approaching Earth and if left unattended, it will end life on Earth as we know it. Fortunately you have KK nuclear plasma blasters that can destroy an asteroid. The cost of each blast is determined by the size of the asteroid. However, after each blast, the cost required increases. 
If xx is the number of blasts already fired by a blaster BiBi, then the cost of the next blast in the blaster BiBi is (x+1)∗S(x+1)∗S where SS is the size of the asteroid. You are free to use any number of the available KK blasters. 
Can you avoid this collision course by finding the minimum cost required to save our planet?
Since the results can be large, output result modulo 1000000007 (109+7109+7).
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
First line of each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers N,KN,K.
Second line of each testcase contains NN spaced integers denoting the size of the asteroid. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line the minimum cost required to destroy all the asteroids modulo 1000000007.

EXPLANATION 1:
We have 33 plasma blasters,                                                                     
1st1st and 2nd2nd asteroid can be shot by blaster 11:
Cost=(4∗14∗1)+(2∗22∗2)=88
3rd3rd and 4th4th asteroid can be shot by blaster 22:
Cost=(5∗15∗1)+(3∗23∗2)=1111
5th5th asteroid can be shot by blaster 33:
Cost=(9∗19∗1)=99
Therefore, Total Cost = 8+11+98+11+9 = 2828.
It can be verified that any other possible combination results in a larger cost.
