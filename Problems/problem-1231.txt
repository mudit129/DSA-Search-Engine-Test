Daniil is a royal gardener. He takes care of a garden with NN plants numbered 11 through NN. For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), the initial height of the ii-th plant is AiAi. Unfortunately, the Queen doesn't like the garden, so she asked Daniil to cut some plants — in order to satisfy the Queen's request, the ii-th plant should have height BiBi (for each 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N).
Daniil is allowed to perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times (including zero):

Let's denote the current heights of plants by H1,H2,…,HNH1,H2,…,HN.
Choose two indices LL and RR (1≤L≤R≤N1≤L≤R≤N) and a new height hh such that h≤Hih≤Hi for each ii between LL and RR inclusive.
Cut plants LL through RR down to height hh, i.e. change the height of plant ii to hh for each L≤i≤RL≤i≤R.

Some time ago, Daniil was one of the best competitive programmers. Therefore, he is interested in the minimum number of operations needed to satisfy the Queen's request. Can you help him?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN denoting the number of plants.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN denoting the initial heights of plants.
The third line contains NN space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN denoting the final heights of plants.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of operations needed to obtain the desired sequence of heights or −1−1 if it is impossible.

Explanation
Example case 1:
Daniil can perform two operations: reduce the height of the first plant to 22 and reduce the height of the third plant to 22. Note that it is not possible to reduce the heights of all three plants to 22 in one operation, because the second plant's height is less than 22. We need two operations, thus the answer is 22.
Example case 2:
In the first operation, cut the plants in the interval [2,4][2,4] down to height 22. Afterwards, cut the third plant down to height 11. Finally, cut the plants in the interval [6,7][6,7].
Example case 3:
All plants already have the desired heights, so the answer is 00.
Example case 4:
It is impossible to achieve the desired sequence of heights.
