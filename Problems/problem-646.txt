In a game there are MM boxes, each containing AjAj grams of gold. In a turn, NN chains are kept on the ground with LiLi and RiRi denoting the coordinates of the left and right end of the ithith chain. You are allowed to lock at most one box of gold in each turn. To lock a box containing AjAj grams of gold, you need a chain of thickness PP and length at least AjAj. To get a thickness of PP you need to join PP chains in place (you cannot drag the chains in any direction) and remove the extra part of the chains which are not helping in forming thickness PP. The length of the resultant (continuous) is the length of the joined chain of thickness PP. You win the gold present in your lockedlocked box. Given TT turns with different settings of chains, find the maximum amount of gold you can win in each turn. 
[All the turns are independent, i.e. if a box was locked in the previous turn, it is unlocked before the next turn.]
Input:

First line of the input contains a single integer MM describing the number of boxes.
Second line of the input contains MM space separated integers denoting A1,A2….AMA1,A2….AM.
Third line of the input contains a single integer TT describing the number of turns. The description of TT turns follows:
First line of each turn contains two space separated integers NN and PP.
This is followed by NN lines. For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), the ithith of these lines contains two space separated integers LiLi and RiRi.

Output:
For each of the turn, print the weight of gold won in grams.
