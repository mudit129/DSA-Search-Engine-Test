Bob is currently at origin. Bob walks on XX-axis and towards the right. In one move, Bob can either jump 1 unit to the right or 2 units to the right. Some of these coordinates are dirty. Bob wants to know the number of ways going to (Y,0)(Y,0) from (0,0)(0,0). Two ways are considered to be different if there exists an integer jj such that the location of Bob after jj steps is different.
Sounds like a well known problem? Bob quickly came up with a perfect solution.
A valid path should contain '.' which represents a clean coordinate or '#' which represents a dirty coordinate.
If the length of the path is LENLEN, then Bob's program calculates and prints number of ways to reach (LEN−1,0)(LEN−1,0) from (0,0)(0,0).
An integer XX is considered to be a good integer if Bob's program prints XX for some valid path.
You have to write a program to output YY, where YY is NthNth good number in the range LL to RR. You should also print the valid path that would make Bob's program output YY.
If there are multiple valid paths, you can output any of them. Please see the output section for more details.
Input

The first line of the input contains an integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains 3 space separated integers LL, RR, and NN.

Output
For each test case, output the NthNth good number, followed by space, followed by a valid path. If no such number exists, just output −1−1.
A valid path should contain '.' which represent a clean coordinate or '#' which represents a dirty coordinate.
For example, "..##.." represents 66 coordinates, (0,0)(0,0) (1,0)(1,0) …… (5.0)(5.0) out of which (2,0)(2,0) and (3,0)(3,0) are dirty.

Explanation
Testcase 11:
Good numbers in range [1,3][1,3] are 11, 22, 33. 1st1st of those is 11. There is one way to reach (0,0)(0,0) from (0,0)(0,0).
Testcase 22:
Good numbers in range [6,9][6,9] are 66, 88, 99. 3rd3rd of those is 99.
Testcase 44:
There are only 33 good numbers in range [6,9][6,9].
