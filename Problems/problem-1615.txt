Chef is planning to buy a new car for his birthday. After a long search, he is left with 22 choices:

Car 1: Runs on diesel with a fuel economy of x1x1 km/l
Car 2: Runs on petrol with a fuel economy of x2x2 km/l

Chef also knows that

the current price of diesel is y1y1 rupees per litre
the current price of petrol is y2y2 rupees per litre

Assuming that both cars cost the same and that the price of fuel remains constant, which car will minimize Chef's expenses?
Print your answer as a single integer in the following format

If it is better to choose Car 1, print −1−1
If both the cars will result in the same expenses, print 00
If it is better to choose Car 2, print 11

Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line containing 44 space-separated integers — x1,x2,y1,y2x1,x2,y1,y2.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the answer as explained earlier.

Explanation
Test Case 11: The cost of driving Car 1 is 310=0.3310=0.3 rs/km, and the cost of driving Car 2 is 205=4205=4 rs/km. Therefore, Car 1 is cheaper to drive, so the output is −1−1.
Test Case 22: The cost of driving Car 1 is 11 rs/km, and the cost of driving Car 2 is also 11 rs/km. Both cars offer the same economy, so the output is 00.
Test Case 33: The cost of driving Car 1 is 33 rs/km and the cost of driving Car 2 is 0.40.4 rs/km. Therefore, Car 2 is cheaper to drive, so the output is 11.
