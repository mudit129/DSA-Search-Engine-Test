Chef has a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN; each element of this sequence is either 00 or 11. Appy gave him a string SS with length QQ describing a sequence of queries. There are two types of queries:

'!': right-shift the sequence AA, i.e. replace AA by another sequence B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN satisfying Bi+1=AiBi+1=Ai for each valid ii and B1=ANB1=AN
'?': find the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of AA with length ≤K≤K such that each element of this subsequence is equal to 11

Answer all queries of the second type.
Input

The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers NN, QQ and KK.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
The third line contains a string with length QQ describing queries. Each character of this string is either '?', denoting a query of the second type, or '!', denoting a query of the first type.

Output
For each query of the second type, print a single line containing one integer — the length of the longest required subsequence.

Explanation

In the first query, there are two longest contiguous subsequences containing only 11-s: A1,A2A1,A2 and A4,A5A4,A5. Each has length 22.
After the second query, the sequence AA is [1,1,1,0,1][1,1,1,0,1].
In the third query, the longest contiguous subsequence containing only 11-s is A1,A2,A3A1,A2,A3.
After the fourth query, A=[1,1,1,1,0]A=[1,1,1,1,0].
In the fifth query, the longest contiguous subsequence containing only 11-s is A1,A2,A3,A4A1,A2,A3,A4 with length 44. However, we only want subsequences with lengths ≤K≤K. One of the longest such subsequences is A2,A3,A4A2,A3,A4, with length 33.
