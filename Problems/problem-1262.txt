You are given a rooted tree with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN); vertex 11 is the root. Each vertex has a weight; let's denote the weight of vertex ii by wiwi.
You should answer QQ queries. The queries have to be processed online, i.e. to obtain each query, you need the answer to the previous query.
In each query, you are given a vertex vv and a parameter kk. For each vertex uu in the subtree of vv (including vv), consider the value wu⊕kwu⊕k (⊕⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation). The answer to this query is the maximum of these values and the smallest uu such that vertex uu is in the subtree of vertex vv and wu⊕kwu⊕k is equal to this maximum.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers w1,w2,…,wNw1,w2,…,wN.
Each of the next N−1N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers xx and yy denoting that there is an edge between nodes xx and yy.
The next QQ lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers aa and bb. The parameters vv and kk can be obtained in the following way: let's denote the value and vertex from the answer to the previous query by xlxl and vlvl respectively (xl=vl=0xl=vl=0 if this is the first query); then, v=a⊕vlv=a⊕vl and k=b⊕xlk=b⊕xl.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing two space-separated integers — the answer to the query, i.e. the number of the vertex for which we get the maximum value and the maximum value.
