The beauty of an (non-empty) array of integers is defined as the difference between its largest and smallest element.
For example, the beauty of the array [2,3,4,4,6][2,3,4,4,6] is 6−2=46−2=4.
An array AA is said to be good if it is possible to partition the elements of AA into two non-empty arrays B1B1 and B2B2  such that 

B1B1 and B2B2 have the same beauty.
Each element of array AA should be in exactly one array: either in B1B1 or in B2B2.

For example, the array [6,2,4,4,4][6,2,4,4,4] is good because its elements can be partitioned into two arrays B1=[6,4,4]B1=[6,4,4] and B2=[2,4]B2=[2,4], where both B1B1 and B2B2 have the same beauty (6−4=4−2=26−4=4−2=2).  
You are given an array AA of length NN. In one move you can:

Select an index ii (1≤i≤N)(1≤i≤N) and either increase AiAi by 11 or decrease AiAi by 11.

Find the minimum number of moves required to make the array AA good.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follow.
Each testcase contains two lines.
The first line contains NN, the length of the array.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,...,ANA1,A2,...,AN representing the initial array.

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line, the minimum number of moves required to make the given array good.
Constraints

1≤T≤1051≤T≤105
2≤N≤1052≤N≤105
−109≤Ai≤109−109≤Ai≤109
Sum of NN does not exceeds 5⋅1055⋅105 over all testcases

Explanation
Test Case 1: We can increase the first element(A1A1) by 22 in two moves. Now, the array AA becomes [6,2,6][6,2,6], and is good, since it can be partitioned into two arrays, ([2],[6,6][2],[6,6]), each with beauty 00. 
Test Case 2: The given array ([−2,4,−2,4][−2,4,−2,4]) is good since it can be partitioned into two arrays ([−2,−2],[4,4][−2,−2],[4,4]), each with beauty 00. Alternatively, it is also possible to partition it into ([−2,4],[−2,4][−2,4],[−2,4]), each with beauty 66.
