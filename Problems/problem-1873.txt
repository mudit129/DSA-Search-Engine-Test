Chef and his friend Bharat have decided to play the game "The Chefora Spell".
In the game, a positive integer NN (in decimal system) is considered a "Chefora" if the number of digits dd is odd and it satisfies the equation N=∑i=0d−1Ni⋅10i,N=∑i=0d−1Ni⋅10i,
where NiNi is the ii-th digit of NN from the left in 00-based indexing.
Let AiAi denote the ii-th smallest Chefora number.
They'll ask each other QQ questions, where each question contains two integers LL and RR. The opponent then has to answer with
(∏i=L+1R(AL)Ai)mod109+7.(∏i=L+1R(AL)Ai)mod109+7.
Bharat has answered all the questions right, and now it is Chef's turn. But since Chef fears that he could get some questions wrong, you have come to his rescue!
Input

The first line contains an integer QQ - the number of questions Bharat asks.
Each of the next QQ lines contains two integers LL and RR.

Output
Print QQ integers - the answers to the questions on separate lines.

For the first question:
(A1)A2=12=1.(A1)A2=12=1.
For the second question:
(A9)A10⋅(A9)A11=9101⋅9111≡541416750(mod109+7).(A9)A10⋅(A9)A11=9101⋅9111≡541416750(mod109+7).
