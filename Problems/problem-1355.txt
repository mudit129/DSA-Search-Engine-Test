Arya is a country with NN cities (numbered 11 through NN). We may assume that the map of Arya is a tree with NN vertices corresponding to the cities, rooted at the city number 11. The coronavirus has spread all over the world and unfortunately, Arya is infected too.
The government is trying to defeat this virus. Their scientists made a medicine which can be used to cure parts of the country. We know that there is an integer kk with the following meaning: for each city vv, if we give the medicine to people in this city, then this city and all cities in its subtree such that their distance from vv is at most kk become cured. When a city is cured, it never becomes infected again.
Clearly, to cure the whole tree, this procedure has to be repeated one or more times; let's say when we give medicine to people in one city, we need to spend one unit of medicine. Now, for each possible kk, the government wants to know the minimum number of units of medicine that need to be produced in order to cure all cities, and they told the National Olympiad in Informatics Committee to solve this critical problem.
For each possible value of kk (1≤k≤N1≤k≤N), let's denote the minimum required number of units of medicine by akak. Can you find S=∑Ni=1aiS=∑i=1Nai?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
Each of the next N−1N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting that cities uu and vv are connected by an edge.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer SS.

Explanation
Example case 1: For any k>1k>1, we can cure all cities by giving just one unit of medicine to people in the city 11, but for k=1k=1, we need at least two units of medicine (for the cities 11 and 44).
