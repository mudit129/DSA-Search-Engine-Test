Monica has a crush on Ross's friend and wants to go out with him. But he is a very geeky person and wants Monica to solve his Word Game for going out. The game contains a string SS consisting of uppercase Latin letters (′A′−′Z′)(′A′−′Z′). Now Monica is given NN words(A1,A2,...,An)(A1,A2,...,An) arranged vertically one below the other.   
The rules of the game are:  

She can swap two consecutive letters of any word AiAi.For example, if word AiAi is "word", she can change it to "owrd" by swapping "w" and "o" or she can change it to "wrod" by swapping "r" and  "o". She can use swapping in a word any number of times including zero.  
She cannot swap letters of two different words.  
Using rule 11 and 22, she has to make string SS by using the first letter of each word AiAi staring from i=1i=1 to i=ni=n without changing the order of words and without skipping any word ie. letter SiSi should be the first letter of AiAi.  

Tell whether or not she will be able to make the given string SS in the game.  
Input:
The first line of the input contains TT, the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a string SS. The second line of each test case contains an integer NN. Each of the next NN lines contains a single string AiAi.  
Output:
For each test case output a single word in each line, "YES" if possible else "NO".  
Constraints

1≤T≤101≤T≤10 
1≤N≤1051≤N≤105 
1≤|S|≤1051≤|S|≤105 
1≤|Ai|≤1051≤|Ai|≤105 
All letters in the strings are uppercase latin letter (′A′−′Z′)(′A′−′Z′).  
Sum of |S||S| and |Ai||Ai| over all test cases does not exceed 2∗1062∗106 

Sample Input:
2
LIKE
4
LEFT
PIN
KEYS
HELLO
LIKE
3
LEFT
KEYS
HELLO

Sample Output:
YES
NO

EXPLANATION:
For the first test case, one possible arrangement will be:  
LEFT
IPN
KEYS
EHLLO

The first letters in order from 1 to 4 will be L,I,K,E respectively. So we will get our string.
For the second test case, no possible arrangement is there as there are not enough strings as required.
