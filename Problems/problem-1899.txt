Sardar Khan has finally decided to attack Ramadhir - he will bomb one of Ramadhir's businesses in Wasseypur. Sardar Khan knows that Ramadhir has NN businesses (numbered 11 to NN) and that there are N−1N−1 roads connecting pairs of these businesses in such a way that all businesses are connected. Further, Sardar knows that each business has a specific value - the ii-th business has value AiAi.
When Sardar Khan destroys a business, he also destroys every road directly connected to it.
Formally, destroying business vv also destroys all existing roads of the form (u,v)(u,v).
Sardar thinks that the damage dealt to Ramadhir upon destroying business vv equals the sum of the greatest common divisors of every remaining maximal connected set of businesses. More formally,

Let the connected components of the graph obtained on deleting vv and edges incident to it be C1,C2,…,CkC1,C2,…,Ck.
Define gcd(Ci)gcd(Ci) to be gcd(Ai1,Ai2,…,Air)gcd(Ai1,Ai2,…,Air) where CiCi consists of vertices i1,i2,…,iri1,i2,…,ir.
The damage caused by destroying vv is then ∑ki=1gcd(Ci)∑i=1kgcd(Ci).

Sardar Khan wants to maximize the damage he deals. Can you find the maximum possible damage he can achieve, given that he destroys exactly one business?
If the process of computing damage is still unclear, please refer to sample test cases for an explained example.
Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer TT, denoting the total number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN, denoting the number of businesses Ramadhir owns.
Each of the next N−1N−1 lines contains 22 integers aa and bb, denoting a road between businesses aa and bb.
Finally, the last line of each test case contains NN space-separated positive integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN, where AiAi is the value of the ii-th business.

Output Format

For each test case, output a single line containing one integer - the maximum possible damage that Sardar Khan can deal.

Explanation

If business 11 is bombed, the remaining connected components are {(2),(3,4,5)}{(2),(3,4,5)}. This gives a damage of gcd(A2)+gcd(A3,A4,A5)=6+1=7gcd(A2)+gcd(A3,A4,A5)=6+1=7.
If business 22 is bombed, the remaining connected components are {(1,3,4,5)}{(1,3,4,5)}. This gives a damage of gcd(A1,A3,A4,A5)=1gcd(A1,A3,A4,A5)=1.
If business 33 is bombed, the remaining connected components are {(1,2),(4),(5)}{(1,2),(4),(5)}. This gives a damage of gcd(A1,A2)+gcd(A4)+gcd(A5)=2+12+15=29gcd(A1,A2)+gcd(A4)+gcd(A5)=2+12+15=29.
If business 44 is bombed, the remaining connected components are {(1,2,3,5)}{(1,2,3,5)}. This gives a damage of gcd(A1,A2,A3,A5)=1gcd(A1,A2,A3,A5)=1.
If business 55 is bombed, the remaining connected components are {(1,2,3,4)}{(1,2,3,4)}. This gives a damage of gcd(A1,A2,A3,A4)=2gcd(A1,A2,A3,A4)=2.

Clearly, bombing business 33 gives the maximum possible damage, that being 29.
