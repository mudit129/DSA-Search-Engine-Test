Chef has a complete binary tree with depth DD and N=2D+1−1N=2D+1−1 nodes (numbered 11 through N). Node 1 is the root and each edge is either white or black. The shape of the tree is as follows:

Let's number the levels of the tree 0 through D from top to bottom. Each node at an odd level is connected to its parent with a white edge (e.g. edges 1−2 and 1−3), while each node at an even level is connected to its parent with a black edge (e.g. edges 2−4, 2−5, 3−6, 3−7).
Chef's friend Alice wants to pick two distinct nodes u and v and a colour C (white or black) uniformly randomly and add an edge between the nodes u and v with colour C. It is allowed for two parallel edges to exist between nodes u and v after this operation.
A strip is an alternating cycle of white and black edges. Each vertex may appear any number of times in a strip. Find the probability that a strip is created when Alice adds an edge to the graph. It can be proved that this probability can be expressed as a fraction PQ, where P and Q are positive integers and Q is coprime with 1,000,000,007. You should compute P⋅Q−1 modulo 1,000,000,007, where Q−1 denotes the multiplicative inverse of Q modulo 1,000,000,007.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer D.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer P⋅Q−1 modulo 1,000,000,007 (109+7).

Explanation
Example case 1: Alice picks one of the following pairs (u,v): (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,1), (3,1) and (3,2). She also picks a colour, but a strip can be created only if Alice picks the colour black and one of the pairs (1,2), (2,1), (1,3) or (3,1), so the probability is 4/12=1/3, which is 333,333,336 modulo 1,000,000,007.
