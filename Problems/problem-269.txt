Chef has a sequence of integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. He takes a sheet of paper and for each non-empty subsequence BB of this sequence, he does the following:

For each integer which appears in BB, count its number of occurrences in the sequence BB.
Choose the integer with the largest number of occurrences. If there are several options, choose the smallest one.
Finally, write down the chosen integer (an element of BB) on the sheet of paper.

For each integer between 11 and NN inclusive, find out how many times it appears on Chef's sheet of paper. Since these numbers may be very large, compute them modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,007 (109+7109+7).
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these integers should be the number of occurrences of ii on Chef's sheet of paper.
Constraints

1≤T≤1001≤T≤100
1≤Ai≤N1≤Ai≤N for each valid ii
the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 500,000500,000

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (20 points): the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 5,0005,000
Subtask #2 (10 points): A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN is a permutation of the integers 11 through NN
Subtask #3 (70 points): original constraints

Explanation
Example case 3: There are 77 non-empty subsequences:

[1][1] (Chef writes down 11)
[2][2] (Chef writes down 22)
[2][2] (Chef writes down 22)
[1,2][1,2] (Chef writes down 11)
[1,2][1,2] (Chef writes down 11)
[2,2][2,2] (Chef writes down 22)
[1,2,2][1,2,2] (Chef writes down 22)
