Nazik gave Batman a tree with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN). There are some robbers in the tree; of course, Batman wants to catch the robbers.
Initially, Batman is in a vertex ss and his power is equal to pp. During each of the next MM seconds, the following process happens:

A robber with power rr runs from a vertex xx straight to vertex yy.
Batman either catches the robber or stays in his current vertex (and never catches this robber).
Batman can only catch the robber if Batman's power is strictly greater than the robber's power.
Let's denote Batman's current vertex by ss (s=sis=si initially). To catch the robber, Batman must choose a vertex gg such that each vertex on the simple path between xx and yy (inclusive) lies also on the simple path between ss and gg (inclusive). If it is impossible to choose a vertex gg so that this condition is satisfied, Batman cannot catch this robber.
If Batman catches the robber, gg becomes his current vertex.
After Batman catches this robber, his power increases by tt.

Your task is to calculate the maximum power Batman can have after MM seconds if he chooses the robbers to catch optimally.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, sisi and pp.
Each of the next N−1N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting an edge in the tree between vertices uu and vv.
The next line contains a single integer MM.
Each of the following MM lines contains four integers xx, yy, rr and tt describing a robber.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum possible value of Batman's power after MM seconds.

Explanation
Example case 1:

In the 2-nd second, Batman will go from vertex s=1s=1 to vertex g=5g=5.
In the 4-th second, Batman will go from vertex s=5s=5 to vertex g=6g=6.
Batman should ignore robbers moving in the 1-st, 3-rd and 5-th second.
