The MEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the array. For instance:

The MEX of [2,2,1][2,2,1] is 00, because 00 does not belong to the array.
The MEX of [3,1,0,1][3,1,0,1] is 22, because 00 and 11 belong to the array, but 22 does not.
The MEX of [0,3,1,2][0,3,1,2] is 44, because 0,1,20,1,2 and 33 belong to the array, but 44 does not.

You are given an array AA of length NN. You create a list BB consisting of the MEX-es of all subarrays of the array AA. Formally, for all pairs (l,r)(l,r) such that 1≤l≤r≤N1≤l≤r≤N, you calculate MEX(Al,Al+1,…,Ar)MEX(Al,Al+1,…,Ar) and append the value in the list BB. Find the KK-th smallest value in the list BB.
Note: Since the size of the input and output is large, please use fast input-output methods.
Input Format

The first line contains TT denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN denoting the given array.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line the KK-th smallest value in the list BB.

Explanation
Test case 11: MEX(A1)=0MEX(A1)=0, MEX(A1,A2)=2MEX(A1,A2)=2, MEX(A1,A2,A3)=3MEX(A1,A2,A3)=3, MEX(A2)=1MEX(A2)=1, MEX(A2,A3)=1MEX(A2,A3)=1, MEX(A3)=0MEX(A3)=0. Hence the list B=[0,2,3,1,1,0]B=[0,2,3,1,1,0] and the 44-th smallest value in BB is 11.
Test case 22: The MEX of all subarrays of the array AA is 00. Hence the 22-nd smallest element in the list BB is 00.
