Mudit, Aakash, and Vaibhav are good friends. Once, they went for a jungle adventure. There, the trio came to know about a mysterious Apple tree. The trio thought of eating apples from the tree. The tree was rooted at node 11 and consisted of total NN nodes including node 11. Every node has an apple and a value associated with the node. The nodes are connected by edges having some weight ww. The trio can move from any node vv to node uu and eat the apple at node uu, only if node uu is not node vv and node uu is in the subtree of node vv and the path weight (from node vv to node uu) is less than or equals to the value associated at the destination node, i.e, value at node uu.
Thus, for each node v, the trio wants to know the number of vertices they can reach from node v and can eat the apples. Please help them.
Input:

The first line contains an integer NN, denoting the number of nodes in the tree.
The second line contains an array AA of NN integers, denoting the value associated at each node.
The next N−1N−1 lines contains three integers uu,vv, and ww, denoting an edge between vertices uu and vv having weight ww.

Output:
Print an array of NN integers denoting the number of nodes visited from the ith node.
