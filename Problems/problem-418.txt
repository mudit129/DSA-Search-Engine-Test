You are provided with a weighted undirected graph GG and string SS. Each node in GG has a letter attached to it. Find the minimum cost of a walk in GG such that the path contains SS as a subsequence i.e. SS can be formed by removing 00 or more characters from the string formed by the concatenation of letters on the nodes on the walk.
You are allowed to begin as well as end your walk at any vertex. Also, you can visit any vertex any number of times.
Input:

First line contains integer TT, representing number of test cases. Each test case is as follows.
The first line contains integers NN and MM and XX - Number of nodes and edges  and the length of string respectively.
The second line contains string SS.
The third line contains NN characters. ith character represents the letter attached to the ith node.
Following MM lines contain u v wu v w. This means uu and vv are connected by an edge weight ww.

Output:
Output a single integer that represents the minimum cost of the path that contains SS as a sub-sequence.
If there is no path that contains SS as a sub-sequence then output -1.

Sample Output:
4

EXPLANATION:
The path will be:
1 - 3 - 1 - 3 - 4
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
