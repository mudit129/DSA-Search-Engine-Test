Chef organized a Football tournament. NN teams participated in the contest and every team was given a number 11 to NN according to their arrival. The tournament rules are as follows 

Each team has to play against N−1N−1 teams
In the ithith game winner team will get +4+4 points and the losing team will get 00 points
If a game is a draw then both teams will get +1+1 points
After the tournament is over the team which has the maximum point will be declared the winner 
If more than one team has the Maximum point then the team who scored the maximum goals between them will be the winner.

Your task is to help the Chef find which team has won the Tournament.
Input:

The first line will contain an Integer NN denoting the number of Teams participated in the Tournament. 
From Second line there are N∗(N−1)/2N∗(N−1)/2 lines containing four Integers T1T1 T2T2 G1G1 G2G2.
T1T1 T2T2denoting the Team numbers and G1G1 G2G2 are the goals scored by the teams respectively.

Output:
You have to output a single Integer Denoting the Number of the team who won the tournament.
Constraints

1≤N≤1051≤N≤105
1≤T1,T2≤N1≤T1,T2≤N
0≤G1,G2≤1090≤G1,G2≤109

Sample Input:
4
1 2 2 1
1 3 1 1
4 2 2 3
4 1 1 0
3 4 3 0
3 2 0 0

Sample Output:
3

EXPLANATION:
Team  Score  Goals
1       5       3
2       5       4
3       6       4
4       4       3

Here we can see clearly that Team 3 has the maximum points i.e. Team 3 is the winner.
