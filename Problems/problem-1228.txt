A string with length LL is called rich if L≥3L≥3 and there is a character which occurs in this string strictly more than L/2L/2 times.
You are given a string SS and you should answer QQ queries on this string. In each query, you are given a substring SL,SL+1,…,SRSL,SL+1,…,SR. Consider all substrings of this substring. You have to determine whether at least one of them is rich.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ.
The second line contains a single string SS with length NN.
Each of the next QQ lines contains two space-separated integers LL and RR describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing the string "YES" if the given substring contains a rich substring or "NO" if it does not contain any rich substring.
