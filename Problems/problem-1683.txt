Consider a seven-segment display, which can be used to show a decimal digit (00 through 99). When a digit is shown on a working display, specific segments of the display turn on, as depicted in the following image (for digits 11 through 99):

00 is depicted as usual, with all the segments turned on, except the middle one.
Some of the segments of this display (possibly all or none) are dead ― they never turn on. In order to find out which segments could be dead, we ran NN tests with the display. For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), in the ii-th test, we tried to show the digit xixi and out of the 77 segments of the display, yiyi segments turned on.
It is possible that the results of tests have been recorded incorrectly. Determine if the recorded results are valid, i.e. if there is a set of dead segments such that in each test, the recorded number of segments that turned on is correct. If it is valid, calculate the minimum possible number of dead segments and the maximum possible number of dead segments consistent with the results of the tests.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
NN lines follow. For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers xixi and yiyi.

Output
For each test case:

If the results of tests are invalid, print a single line containing the string "invalid" (without quotes).
Otherwise, print a single line containing two space-separated integers ― the minimum and maximum number of dead segments.
