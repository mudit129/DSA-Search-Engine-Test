You are given an integer N. You have to arrange all integers in range(0≤i<N0≤i<N) in M arrays such that each array consists of only distinct elements in it and all M arrays have the equal size. But there is one twist. You are also given an integer K and you have to ensure that union of any k or more arrays should result in the complete set of elements (0≤i<N0≤i<N) but union of any number of arrays less than k should not satisfy the same.
Print the answer arrays in lexicographically increasing manner.
Note: A solution may or may not exist depending on values of N,M,K. But we have made sure to test your solution only on those input values for which solution exists.
Input:

single-line will contain 3 integers N, M, K.

Output:

M lines will contain M arrays in non-decreasing order.

Constraints

1≤N≤6450
1≤M≤15
1≤K≤15

Sample Input:
10 5 3

Sample Output:
 0 1 2 4 5 7 
 0 1 3 4 6 8 
 0 2 3 5 6 9 
 1 2 3 7 8 9 
 4 5 6 7 8 9   

EXPLANATION:
Here N=10 hence elements will be 0,1,2,3,…,9.
M arrays are in non-decreasing order and none of the arrays has repeated elements.
Union of any k (3)  arrays results in the N set. 
e.g 
1 U 2 U 3 = (0 1 2 4 5 7) U (0 1 3 4 6 8) U (0 2 3 5 6 9)= 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
1 U 3 U 5= (0 1 2 4 5 7) U (0 2 3 5 6 9) U (4 5 6 7 8 9) = 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
2 U 4 U 5 = (0 1 3 4 6 8) U (1 2 3 7 8 9) U (4 5 6 7 8 9) = 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
But any number less than k do not satisfy this. ( no 2 arrays can complete the set as  2<k ).
