In a country Stone Land, there are NN stones arranged in a row from left to right. Each stone has some height represented by a positive number. The stones are numbered from 11 to NN from left to right.
You are given an array H of size NN consisting of the height of the NN stones from left to
right.
Stone at jthjth position is visible from the stone at ithith position if:-

j>ij>i
max(H[i],H[i+1],H[i+2],....,H[j−1])max(H[i],H[i+1],H[i+2],....,H[j−1]) << H[j]H[j]

You are asked MM queries.

Each query consists of two different positions of stones AA and BB.
You have to Print the total number of stones that are visible from both the stones at the position AA and BB.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM, where NN is the number of stones and MM is the number of queries.
The Second line consists of NN space-separated integers (array H) denoting the height of stones from left to the right separated by a space.
Next, MM lines consist of two space-separated integers AA and BB separated by space where AA and BB are positions of stones.

Constraints

1≤T≤51≤T≤5
2≤N≤1052≤N≤105
1≤M≤1051≤M≤105
1≤H[i]≤1091≤H[i]≤109, where H[i] denotes the height of ithith stone, and 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N
1≤A,B≤N1≤A,B≤N
It is guaranteed that the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 105105.
It is guaranteed that the sum of MM over all test cases does not exceed 105105.

Output

For each query, print the total number of stones that are visible from both the stones at the position AA and BB in a new line.

Explanation
Query 11: Stone at position 11 can see the stones at position (2,3,6)(2,3,6) whereas stone at position 22 can see the stones at position (3,6)(3,6). Thus, the total number of stones that are visible from both stones is 22.
