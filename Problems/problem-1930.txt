Consider an array AA of size NN which only contains 1s1s and 0s0s. Let's define 'Group' as the subarray containing only 0s or only 1s. You are also given two values xx and yy. Your task is to flip the values (from 00 to 11 or from 11 to 00) in the array such that length of every 'Group' is between xx and yy (inclusive). But thats not it :p. You are also given another array BB of size NN which consists of the cost of flipping the respective values of array A. Formally, for each position ii from 11 to NN ,the cost of flipping the value of AiAi is BiBi. You need to find the minimum cost such that the resultant array A′A′ satisfy the given condition. 
Note: It is possible that answer does not exist. In that case print -1.
Input
First line contains TT denoting number of test cases.Next line consists of NN denoting the size of the arrays. Next line contains xx and yy as described in the problem.Following line consists of NN space separated integers of array AA where elements can be 00 or 11. Next line consists of NN space separated integers of array BB, cost of flipping the values at ithith position.
Output
If answer exists, print overall minimum cost else print -1 (in new line).
Constraints

11 <= TT <= 7070
11 <= NN <= 10001000
11 <= xx <= yy <= NN
AiAi can be 00 or 11
00 <= BiBi <= 10001000

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (15 points):

11 <= NN <= 1515
Subtask #2 (85 points):

11 <= NN <= 10001000
Example
Input:
1
5
2 3
0 1 0 1 0
10 5 11 4 1

Output:
6

Explanation
Example case 1. The resultant array is [0,0,0,1,1] and the overall minimum cost is 6.
