You're given a simple undirected graph GG with NN vertices and MM edges. You have to assign, to each vertex ii, a number CiCi such that 1≤Ci≤N1≤Ci≤N and ∀i≠j,Ci≠Cj∀i≠j,Ci≠Cj.
For any such assignment, we define DiDi to be the number of neighbours jj of ii such that Cj<CiCj<Ci. 
You want to minimise maxi∈{1..N}Di−mini∈{1..N}Dimaxi∈{1..N}Di−mini∈{1..N}Di.
Output the minimum possible value of this expression for a valid assignment as described above, and also print the corresponding assignment.
Note: 

The given graph need not be connected.
If there are multiple possible assignments, output anyone. 
Since the input is large, prefer using fast input-output methods.

Input Format

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N,MN,M - the number of vertices and edges in the graph respectively.
The next MM lines each contain two integers - X,YX,Y, denoting that there exists an edge between vertex XX and vertex YY.

Output Format
The output of each test case consists of two lines:

The first line contains the minimum possible value of the expression described above.
The second line contains NN space separated integers - the ithith of which is CiCi in the corresponding assignment.

Explanation
Test Case 11: The following assignment is optimal:

C1=1C1=1
C2=2C2=2
C3=3C3=3
C4=4C4=4
C5=5C5=5

We can see that 33 has two neighbours with smaller values - 11 and 22. Vertex 55 is also its neighbour, but has a larger value. Therefore, D3=2D3=2. 
Similarly, we can calculate:

D1=0D1=0
D2=1D2=1
D3=2D3=2
D4=2D4=2
D5=2D5=2

Therefore, maxi∈{1..N}Di−mini∈{1..N}Dimaxi∈{1..N}Di−mini∈{1..N}Di = 2−02−0 = 22. 
Test Case 22: The following assignment is optimal:

C1=5C1=5
C2=3C2=3
C3=1C3=1
C4=2C4=2
C5=4C5=4

The values of DD are:

D1=1D1=1
D2=1D2=1
D3=0D3=0
D4=1D4=1
D5=1D5=1

Therefore, maxi∈{1..N}Di−mini∈{1..N}Dimaxi∈{1..N}Di−mini∈{1..N}Di = 1−01−0 = 11.
