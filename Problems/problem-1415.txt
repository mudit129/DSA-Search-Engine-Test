For this not so interesting problem, you are given N intervals. Each interval has two parameters L and R denoting left and right end-points of the interval. (L ≤ R)

You have to answer Q queries. Each query has two parameters A and B.
For each query, goal is to the find minimum possible value of magic.Magic for a given query is calculated as follows.

magic = 0
for i in range(0, N)
    x = choose any point which lies in ith interval (x ≥ L[i] and x ≤ R[i])
    y = choose A or B
    magic += |x – y|
Input Format
First line of input contains N, the number of intervals.
Next N lines, each contains two integers L and R.
Next line has Q, the number of queries.
Next Q lines, each contains two integers A and B.
Output Format
Output Q lines, where ith line contains minimum possible value of magic for ith query.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 105
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 5 * 108
1 ≤ Q ≤ 105 
1 ≤ A, B ≤ 5 * 108
