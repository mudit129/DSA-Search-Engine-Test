Swati loves Sstrings. She considers an ordinary string to be a Sstring if it contains the substring "SS". Now for a given string SS and an integer NN, she creates a new string S′=S+S+⋯+Sconcatenating N timesS′=S+S+⋯+S⏟concatenating N times.
Swati is a very busy girl, and she doesn't have time to find whether S′S′ is a Sstring or not. So she asks you to check whether S′S′ is a Sstring or not. And if it is, find the number of occurrences of the substring "SS" in S′S′. Capiche?
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN.
The second line contains the string SS.

Output:
For each test case print a single line containing a single integer, the number of occurrences of the substring "SS" in S′S′.
If S′S′ is not a Sstring, then print 00.
Constraints:

1≤T≤101≤T≤10
1≤N,|S|≤1051≤N,|S|≤105
(|S||S| is the length of the string SS)
SS contains only uppercase English alphabets
