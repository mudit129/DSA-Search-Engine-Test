There are two merchants in the market. Initially, the first merchant has NN items for sale at distinct prices A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and the second merchant has MM items for sale at distinct prices B1,B2,…,BMB1,B2,…,BM.
If you buy an item from a merchant, the prices of all remaining items for both merchants change in the following manner:

The cost of all the remaining items of the chosen merchant will increase by 11. 
The cost of all the remaining items of the other merchant will decrease by 11. 

Note that prices may become negative during this process.
For e.g. if A=[3,4,5],B=[1,3,4]A=[3,4,5],B=[1,3,4] and you buy the second item from the second merchant then the prices of remaining items will be as follows A=[2,3,4],B=[2,−,5]A=[2,3,4],B=[2,−,5]
You can only buy an item if its cost is at most CC. Can you buy all items from both merchants in the market in some order?
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT - the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three integers NN, MM and CC - the number of items of the first merchant, the number of items of the second merchant and the maximum cost of an item you can buy respectively.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1<A2<⋯<ANA1<A2<⋯<AN - the prices of items of first merchant.
The third line contains MM space-separated integers B1<B2<⋯<BMB1<B2<⋯<BM - the prices of items of second merchant.

Output Format
For each test case, output Yes if it is possible to buy all items from both merchants in the market in some order. Otherwise, output No.
You may print each character of Yes and No in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be treated as identical).

Explanation
Test case 1: One possible sequence of operations is shown below. The item we purchase in a given turn is highlighted in red.

A=[1],B=[1,2]A=[1],B=[1,2]
A=[−],B=[0,1]A=[−],B=[0,1]
A=[−],B=[1,−]A=[−],B=[1,−]

Test case 2:  One possible sequence of operations is shown below. The item we purchase in a given turn is highlighted in red.

A=[1,2],B=[1]A=[1,2],B=[1]
A=[2,−],B=[0]A=[2,−],B=[0]
A=[−,−],B=[−1]A=[−,−],B=[−1]

Note that prices may become negativenegative during this process and in such a case the item can still be bought.
Test case 3: It can be shown that there is no way to buy the second item sold by Merchant 22 regardless of the order in which we buy the items.
Test case 4: One possible sequence of operations is shown below. The item we purchase in a given turn is highlighted in red.

A=[2,4,8],B=[1,4,8]A=[2,4,8],B=[1,4,8]
A=[−,5,9],B=[0,3,7]A=[−,5,9],B=[0,3,7]
A=[−,4,8],B=[1,4,−]A=[−,4,8],B=[1,4,−]
A=[−,3,7],B=[2,−,−]A=[−,3,7],B=[2,−,−]
A=[−,4,−],B=[1,−,−]A=[−,4,−],B=[1,−,−]
A=[−,−,−],B=[0,−,−]A=[−,−,−],B=[0,−,−]
