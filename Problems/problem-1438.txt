A binary string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters of the string are equal. Formally, a binary string TT of length MM is called alternating if Ti≠Ti+1Ti≠Ti+1 for each 1≤i<M1≤i<M. 
For example, 0, 1, 01, 10, 101, 010, 1010 are alternating strings while 11, 001, 1110 are not.
You are given a binary string SS of length NN. You would like to rearrange the characters of SS such that the length of the longest alternating substring of SS is maximum. Find this maximum value.
A binary string is a string that consists of characters 0 and 1. A string aa is a substring of a string bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.
Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The TT test cases then follow:
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN.
The second line of each test case contains the binary string SS.

Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum possible length of the longest alternating substring of SS after rearrangement.
Constraints

1≤T≤1041≤T≤104
1≤N≤1051≤N≤105
SS contains only the characters 0 and 1.
Sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.

Explanation
Test case 11: Swapping the second and third characters makes S=101S=101. Hence the length of the longest alternating substring is 33 (choosing the entire string as a substring).
Test case 22: The given string S=1010S=1010 is an alternating string of length 44.
Test case 33: The length of the longest alternating substring is 11 for any rearrangement of  S=0000S=0000.
Test case 44: One possible rearrangement of SS is 110101––––––1110101_1, which has an alternating substring of length 55 (the substring starting at index 22 and ending at index 66).
