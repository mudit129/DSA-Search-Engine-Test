There are NN cities on a circle, numbered 11 through NN. For each ii (1≤i≤N−11≤i≤N−1), cities ii and i+1i+1 are directly connected by a bidirectional road with length AiAi, and cities NN and 11 are also directly connected by a bidirectional road with length ANAN. However, we do not know the lengths of some roads.
For each city ii, we do know that it has an opposite city — formally, there is a city j≠ij≠i such that the clockwise distance between cities ii and jj is equal to the counterclockwise distance between these cities.
Please find the lengths of all roads in such a way that the above condition is satisfied and the sum of lengths of all roads is minimised.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of the input contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. For each valid ii, Ai=−1Ai=−1 denotes that the length of road ii is unknown.

Output
For each test case, print a line containing the string "NO" if there is no solution or "YES" otherwise. If a solution exists, print a second line containing NN space-separated positive integers — the lengths of all roads in your solution. Each of these integers should be ≤109≤109. If there are multiple solutions, you may print any one.
