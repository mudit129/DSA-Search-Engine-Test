You are given a sequence of non-negative integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and QQ queries. A sequence is good if the bitwise AND of all its elements is a perfect square. In each query:

you are given two parameters LL and RR
consider the subsequence B=AL,AL+1,…,ARB=AL,AL+1,…,AR
you should find the number of good contiguous subsequences of BB 

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
Each of the following QQ lines contains two space-separated integers LL and RR describing one query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the number of good contiguous subsequences.

Explanation
Example case 1: For the first query, there is only one possible subsequence, [2][2]. The AND of its elements is equal to its only element 22, which is not a perfect square.
For the second query, there are six contiguous subsequences:

[1][1]; its AND is 1, a perfect square
[1,2][1,2]; its AND is 0, a perfect square
[1,2,3][1,2,3]; its AND is 0, a perfect square
[2][2]; its AND is 2, not a perfect square
[2,3][2,3]; its AND is 2, not a perfect square
[3][3]; its AND is 3, not a perfect square
