Chef finished inviting all of his friends. Now it is time to get a tree in his house and decorate it for the party. He wants to use the most beautiful tree ever.
The tree Chef chose has NN nodes (numbered 11 through NN) and it is rooted at node 11. For each valid ii, the initial colour of the ii-th node is CiCi and there is a value AiAi written in that node. Chef calculates the beauty of his tree as ∑Ni=1Ai⋅Fi∑i=1NAi⋅Fi, where FiFi denotes the number of distinct colours of nodes in the subtree of the ii-th node (including this node).
Now, Chef is trying to improve the beauty of the tree ― he wants to make QQ updates, where in each update, he chooses a node aa and an integer xx and changes the colour of the node aa to xx. After each update, find the beauty of the tree. Note that the updates are permanent, i.e. they affect all subsequent updates.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ.
Each of the following N−1N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting an edge between nodes uu and vv.
The next line contains NN space-separated integers C1,C2,…,CNC1,C2,…,CN.
The next line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
Each of the following QQ lines contains two space-separated integers aa and xx describing a query.

Output
For each update, print a single line containing one integer ― the beauty of the tree after this update is performed.
