Chef has NN items in his shop (numbered 11 through NN); for each valid ii, the price of the ii-th item is PiPi. Since Chef has very loyal customers, all NN items are guaranteed to be sold regardless of their price.
However, the government introduced a price ceiling KK, which means that for each item ii such that Pi>KPi>K, its price should be reduced from PiPi to KK.
Chef's revenue is the sum of prices of all the items he sells. Find the amount of revenue which Chef loses because of this price ceiling.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers P1,P2,…,PNP1,P2,…,PN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the amount of lost revenue.

Explanation
Test Case 1: The initial revenue is 10+2+3+4+5=2410+2+3+4+5=24. Because of the price ceiling, P1P1 decreases from 1010 to 44 and P5P5 decreases from 55 to 44. The revenue afterwards is 4+2+3+4+4=174+2+3+4+4=17 and the lost revenue is 24−17=724−17=7.
Test Case 2: The initial revenue is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7=281+2+3+4+5+6+7=28. For each valid ii, Pi≤15Pi≤15, so there are no changes, the revenue after introduction of the price ceiling is the same and there is zero lost revenue.
Test Case 3: The initial revenue is 10+9+8+7+6=4010+9+8+7+6=40. Since Pi>5Pi>5 for each valid ii, the prices of all items decrease to 55. The revenue afterwards is 5⋅5=255⋅5=25 and the lost revenue is 40−25=1540−25=15.
