41. First Missing PositiveHard95841348Add to ListShareGiven an unsorted integer array nums, return the smallest missing positive integer.
You must implement an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses constant extra space.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,0]
Output: 3
Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2
Example 3:
Input: nums = [7,8,9,11,12]
Output: 1

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 105
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
