You are given a matrix AA of non-negative integers with NN rows (numbered 11 through NN) and NN columns (numbered 11 through NN). For each valid ii and jj, let's denote the element in the ii-th row and jj-th column by Ai,jAi,j.
You need to find a matrix BB with N+1N+1 rows and N+1N+1 columns (numbered similarly) such that:

each element of this matrix is a digit between 00 and 99 (inclusive)
Ai,j=Bi,j+Bi+1,j+Bi,j+1+Bi+1,j+1Ai,j=Bi,j+Bi+1,j+Bi,j+1+Bi+1,j+1 for each valid i,ji,j

The matrix AA is chosen in such a way that at least one solution exists. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer NN.
NN lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains NN space-separated integers Ai,1,Ai,2,…,Ai,NAi,1,Ai,2,…,Ai,N.

Output
Print N+1N+1 lines. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines should contain N+1N+1 characters Bi,1,Bi,2,…,Bi,N+1Bi,1,Bi,2,…,Bi,N+1.
Constraints
