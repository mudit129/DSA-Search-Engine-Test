You are given an array aa of length NN and QQ queries. Each query is described by a pair of integers, ll and rr. Answer each query with the following: if we take every subsequence of the elements with indices between ll and rr (inclusive) and write down their products, what will be the smallest missing positive integer?
A subsequence of an array is a sequence you obtain by deleting some (possibly zero or all) elements of the array. The product of the empty subsequence is defined to be 11.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aNa1,a2,…,aN.
Each of the next QQ lines contains two space-separated integers, ll and rr, denoting the query's range.

Output
For each query, output the smallest missing subsequence product on a new line.

Explanation
The array is [2,3,2,5,4][2,3,2,5,4].
The first query asks about the range [2,3][2,3]. The subsequences of this range are [][], [3][3], [2][2], and [3,2][3,2]. They have products 11, 33, 22, and 66, respectively. The smallest missing positive integer from the list of products is 44.
The second query asks about the range [1,4][1,4].

[][] has product 11
[2][2] has product 22
[3][3] has product 33
[2,2][2,2] has product 44
[5][5] has product 55
[2,3][2,3] has product 66
But 77 does not appear as a subsequence product in the given range.

The third query asks about the range [3,5][3,5].

[][] has product 11
[2][2] has product 22
But 33 does not appear as a subsequence product in the given range.
