Motu has KK boxes and every box is empty at time tt == 00. Now Patlu gave him coins at some TT instants of time (1,2,3...T)(1,2,3...T) and asked him to put one coin in each box from box LL to RR. Patlu make a record of the data and also asked Motu to do the same. Now he asked Motu some queries and asked him to tell the number of coins present in a box XX from time t1t1 to time t2t2 i.e. number of additional coins that are added to the box XX from [t1,t2)[t1,t2) .
Input:

First line of the input contains two integer, TT and QQ 
Next TT lines contains two integers LL , RR, where coins are put from box LL to box RR.
Next QQ lines contains three integers t1t1 , t2t2 , XX 

Output:
For each query , output in a single line answer, the number of coins present in a box XX from time instant t1t1 to t2t2. i.e [t1,t2)[t1,t2).

EXPLANATION:

Query 1: In time 22 to 44, additional  2 coins are added to box 44.
At instant 2 : 1 coin is added in box 4.
At instant 3 : 1 coin is added in box 4.
So answer is 2.
Query 2: In time 11 to 22, additional  1 coin is added to box 33
 At instant 1:  1 coin is added in box 3.
 So answer is 1.
Query 3: In time 11 to 44, additional 22 coins are added to box 11
 At instant 1: 1 coin is added in box 1. 
 At instant 2: no coin is added in box 1. 
 At instant 3: 1 coin is added in box 1. 
 So answer is 2.
