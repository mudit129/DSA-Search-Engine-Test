  interests.
  One of her interets is to find the number of primes in range
  [l,r] in a given array A.
  She will also ask you to update the value present at the i
  position of the array.
  Formally speaking there will be two types of queries on a
  given array A.

The first query is of type 1 L R. You need to
  print the number of primes in this range(both inclusive).
The second query is of type 2 X Y. You will change the
  the content at index X with Y.

  She will be impressed if you can solve this problem and may
  give you a treat.
 
Input
Input description.

  The first line of input will contain two integers N and
  Q denoting the number of elements in the list and the
    total number of queries respectively.
    The next line will contain N space separated integers
    denoting the content of the array A.
    Next Q lines will be one of the queries.

 
Output
Output description.

For each query of type 1 print the number of primes
present in the given range L R both inclusive.
Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
1 ≤ Q ≤ 100000
1 ≤ L ≤ N
1 ≤ R ≤ N
1 ≤ Ai,Y ≤ 100000

 
Example
Input:
7 4
4 2 7 8 3 9 11
1 1 7
1 2 5
2 3 4
1 2 5

Output:
4
3
2

 
Explanation
Example Query 1.
The number of primes between index 1 and 7 is 4.
Example Query 4.
Because of the previous query the elemnent at index 3 which is 7 is
replaced by 4. So now the array is 4 2 4 8 3 9 11.
And the number of primes between index 2 and index 5 is 2.
