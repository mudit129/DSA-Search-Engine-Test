Nuttela and Horsbug were teasing Shahid, when they suddenly remember the pending assignment. They rushed home to complete the task within the stipulated time.  
Provided with a string SS, they have to find vowels in certain substrings of SS. Since this would be a very easy task, this time the teacher also asked them to update certain substrings of the string.
Looking at the watch, they panic.
They have missed all the deadlines and this is their last chance. So they need your help badly.
Can you help them complete the assignment as fast as possible?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.  
The first line of each test case contains a single string SS.
The second line contains a single integer QQ - the number of queries.
QQ lines follow. Each line contains a query.
There are two types of queries:-
UU LL RR VV - Update the substring SL,SL+1,...,SRSL,SL+1,...,SR by incrementing each character in the substring by VV. We increment a character in a cyclic manner, i.e. by adding 11 to aa becomes bb, and by adding 11 to zz becomes aa.
FF LL RR - Find the number of vowels in the substring SL,SL+1,...,SRSL,SL+1,...,SR. 

Output
For each query of type FLRFLR print a single line containing one integer - the number of vowels in the substring SL,SL+1,…,SRSL,SL+1,…,SR.

SS contains only lowercase English letters

Example Input
1
aeiouz
3
F 1 6
U 1 3 4
F 1 6

Example Output
5
4

Explanation
The number of vowels in the substring S1...S6S1...S6 is 55 initially. After the update SS becomes eimouzeimouz. Now the number of vowels in the substring S1...S6S1...S6 is 44.
