Gru has been ordering the minions to do a lot of work lately. Minions don't want to trust Gru anymore. So, they propose a problem to Gru. They will only help Gru if he can answer the problem correctly. The minions  generate an endless string ss by following these steps:

Let s be an empty string.
i=1.
Append i a s to the back of s.
Append i b s to the back of s.
Multiply i by 2 and go back to the third step.

So s will be abaabbaaaabbbb…. Now let's define f(x) as number of distinct palindrome substring segments in s[1…x]. For example, f(3)=4 because a (which is s[1…1]), b (which is s[2…2]), a (which is s[3…3]) and aba (which is s[1…3]) are possible palindrome substrings of s[1…3].
The minions will give an integer N. Help Gru calculate (∑Ni=1f(i))mod(109+7).
Note: We are using 1-indexing.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains a single line of input, which has one integer, N. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line, the answer modulo (109+7).
Constraints

1≤T≤103
1≤N≤1018

Sample Input:
1
3

Sample Output:
7

EXPLANATION:
f(1)=1, f(2)=2, f(3)=4. And so, the answer for N=3 is 1+2+4=7.
