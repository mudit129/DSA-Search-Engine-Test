You are given two strings SS and AA of lengths NN and MM respectively.

String SS contains characters from the set {?, a, b, c, d, e}{?, a, b, c, d, e}. 
String AA contains characters from the set {a, b, c, d, e}{a, b, c, d, e}. 

Let S′S′ denote the string formed by replacing all the ?? in SS using the characters from the set {a, b, c, d, e}{a, b, c, d, e}.
Construct S′S′ such that AA is not a subsequence of S′S′.
If multiple such S′S′ exist, output any. If no such S′S′ exists, print −1−1.
Input Format

The first line will contain TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers NN and MM - the lengths of strings SS and AA respectively.
The second line of each test case contains string SS.
The third line of each test case contains string AA.

Output Format
For each test case, output any valid string S′S′. If no such string exists, print −1−1.

Explanation
Test case 11: Replace the ?? at indices 11 and 44 using characters aa and ee respectively. Both the characters belong to the set {a, b, c, d, e}{a, b, c, d, e}.
The string S′=aabeS′=aabe. Note that no subsequence of S′S′ is equal to baba.
Test case 22: There is no possible value of S′S′ such that abab is not a subsequence of S′S′.
