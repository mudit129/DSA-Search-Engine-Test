Willow, a 3 years old genius, thought that sorting is based on the last digit of a number. His comparison process is if the last digit of an integer AA is smaller than the last digit of another integer BB ,then AA<BB. And if the last digit of two integers is same then he checks the previous one and this way the comparison continues.
That means, if the digits of an integer AA is represented as  a1a1,a2a2…anan and another integer BB as  b1b1,b2b2…bmbm (n and m not necessary to be equal), AA will be smaller than BB if there is an ii such that AiAi < BiBi and for each valid jj > ii, AjAj = BjBj.
For example,

If A=123A=123 , B=521B=521 then AA > BB.
If AA = 521521 , BB = 518518 then AA < BB

Willow is trying to sort NN numbers in ascending order in his process. Can you help him?
Input Format

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
First line of each testcase contains of a single line of input, one integer NN - number of integers. 
-Then NN line contains NN integers X1X1,X2X2,…,XNXN

Output Format
For p-th testcase, first line will be "Case p:"(Don't put a space after this statement or it may cause WA) and then print the numbers in N line after sorting by Willow's rule.
Constraints

1≤T≤1001≤T≤100
2≤N≤1042≤N≤104
0≤Xi≤1040≤Xi≤104
