Ichika is the daughter of Kaneki and Touka. One day Kaneki and Touka
went for a party and left Ichika at home. Ichika got tired and wanted to do
a trick with her toys. She has NN toys and the weight of the iith toy is ii. Also
being half ghoul she also has a superpower , which is she can make N−1N−1
clones of that type of toy. So at last she has N2N2 toys.
Now, she has infinite bags
in a line. And she starts putting her 1st1st toy in the 1st1st  bag,then the clone
of first toy in the 2nd2nd bag,such that all the clones lie in consecutive
bags ,no bag has same toy and the iith toy is filled from iith bag (she starts
filling first toy from first bag,second toy from second bag and so on).
Being her caretaker you have to pick up all the bags. For that you need the
weight of each bag also the number of bags should be minimum. Your task
is to print the weight of all bags starting from 1st1st bag.
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, one integer NN. 

Output:
Print TT lines, each line should output weight of iith bag separated by space.
