The i-th query is denoted by three positive integers, li, ri and xi. For each query, you should output the maximum possible value of xi xor aj, where l ≤ j ≤ r. 

You may learn about the xor operator here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or (see the part which explains xor on integers)

 
Input
The first line contains a single integer n, the length of the array. The next line contains n space-seperated integers, denoting the elements of a. The next line contains a single integer q, denoting the number of queries. The next q lines contain three space-seperated integers each, denoting li, ri and xi.
 
Output
For each query, output its answer on a single line.
 
Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 300000
1 ≤ q ≤ 100000
1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n
1 ≤ xi,ai ≤ 1000000

Subtasks

Subtask 1 (14 points) : 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3000
Subtask 2 (20 points) : li = L and ri = R for all i for some fixed values L and R.
Subtask 3 (23 points) : xi = 0 for all i
Subtask 4 (43 points) : Original Constraints

 
Example
Input:
5
2 3 6 4 7
3
2 4 6
1 5 1
3 3 6

Output:
5
7
0
 
Explanation
Example case. For the first query, 3 xor 6 = 5 yields the maximum value. For the second query, 6 xor 1 = 7 yields the maximum value. For the third query, 6 xor 6 = 0 is the only possibility and thus yields the maximum value.
