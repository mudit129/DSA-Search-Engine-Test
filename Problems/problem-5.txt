You are participating in a contest which has 1111 problems (numbered 11 through 1111). The first eight problems (i.e. problems 1,2,…,81,2,…,8) are scorable, while the last three problems (99, 1010 and 1111) are non-scorable ― this means that any submissions you make on any of these problems do not affect your total score.
Your total score is the sum of your best scores for all scorable problems. That is, for each scorable problem, you look at the scores of all submissions you made on that problem and take the maximum of these scores (or 00 if you didn't make any submissions on that problem); the total score is the sum of the maximum scores you took.
You know the results of all submissions you made. Calculate your total score.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN denoting the number of submissions you made.
NN lines follow. For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers pipi and sisi, denoting that your ii-th submission was on problem pipi and it received a score sisi.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― your total score.
Constraints

1≤T≤101≤T≤10
1≤N≤1,0001≤N≤1,000
1≤pi≤111≤pi≤11 for each valid ii
0≤si≤1000≤si≤100 for each valid ii

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (15 points): all submissions are on the same problem, i.e. p1=p2=…=pNp1=p2=…=pN
Subtask #2 (15 points): there is at most one submission made on each problem, i.e. pi≠pjpi≠pj for each valid i,ji,j (i≠ji≠j)
Subtask #3 (70 points): original constraints

Explanation
Example case 1: The scorable problems with at least one submission are problems 22 and 88. For problem 22, there are two submissions and the maximum score among them is 4545. For problem 88, there are also two submissions and the maximum score is 9090. Hence, the total score is 45+90=13545+90=135.
Example case 2: No scorable problem is attempted, so the total score is 00.
