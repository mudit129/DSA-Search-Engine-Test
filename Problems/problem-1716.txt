Chef has invited Alice for his birthday party. Now, Alice is thinking about what to give Chef as a present. She should obviously choose a sequence ― what could possibly be a better birthday gift than a sequence!
After some thinking, Alice chose a sequence of integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. However, she does not want to simply give this sequence to Chef. Instead, she decided to give Chef a sequence B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN, where Bi=⋁ij=1AjBi=⋁ij=1Aj for each valid i and ⋁ denotes the bitwise OR operation. Chef can try to generate a sequence A from B, but there could be more than one such possible sequence.
Now, Alice is wondering how many sequences A correspond to the given sequence B. Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo 109+7. Note that it is not guaranteed that the given sequence B was generated from some sequence A.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of possible sequences A modulo 109+7.
Constraints

1≤T≤25
1≤N≤5⋅104
0≤Bi<230 for each valid i
