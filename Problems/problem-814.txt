Flappy Bird is on a screen with height HH pixels (a 2D plane where the yy-axis corresponds to the vertical direction). There are NN vertical obstacles in the room (numbered 11 through NN); for each valid ii, the coordinates of the endpoint of the ii-th obstacle are (xi,ai)(xi,ai). There are two types of obstacles: 

Type 0: A line segment between the points (xi,0)(xi,0) and (xi,ai)(xi,ai), i.e. upwards from the floor.
Type 1: A line segment between the points (xi,H)(xi,H) and (xi,ai)(xi,ai), i.e. downwards from the ceiling.

For each obstacle, you need to find the number of endpoints of other obstacles (not including itself) that are visible from its endpoint. Two endpoints are visible from each other if the line segment joining them does not intersect or touch any other obstacle. Note that each obstacle has exactly one endpoint.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers HH and NN.
The following NN lines describe the obstacles. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers titi, xixi and aiai, where titi is the type of the ii-th obstacle.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these integers should be the number of endpoints visible from the ii-th endpoint.
