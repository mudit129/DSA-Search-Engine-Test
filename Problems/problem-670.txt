You are given a sequence of integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. You may change any number of its elements (possibly zero), obtaining a new sequence of positive integers B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN. Each element of BB must be an integer between 22 and 5050 (both inclusive).
Let's define an undirected graph GG with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN). For each pair of different vertices ii and jj, there is an edge between ii and jj if and only if BiBi and BjBj are coprime.
You should choose the sequence BB in such a way that GG is a connected graph. The number of elements which need to be changed to obtain BB from AA should be minimum possible. Find one such sequence BB and the minimum required number of changes.
It can be proven that a solution always exists — it is always possible to modify sequence AA in such a way that GG is connected.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print two lines. The first line should contain a single integer — the minimum required number of changes. The second line should contain NN space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN — the modified sequence.
If there are multiple solutions, you may print any one.

Explanation
Example 1: There is an edge in GG between vertices 11 and 22. This graph is connected, so there is no need to change any elements.
Example 2: There is no edge between vertices 11 and 22 since gcd(2,4)≠1gcd(2,4)≠1. This graph is not connected. We can change element A2=4A2=4 to 33 and make this graph connected.
