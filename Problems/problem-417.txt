Tumut, the best programmer in his village Applidz, invented a problem and decided to share it with you:
You are given two integer sequences S1,S2,…,SNS1,S2,…,SN and T1,T2,…,TMT1,T2,…,TM and an integer xx. You are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times:

choose an element of SS and an element of TT (let's denote them by SiSi and TjTj respectively)
decrease both SiSi and TjTj by xx, i.e. replace SiSi by Si−xSi−x and TjTj by Tj−xTj−x

Let's denote the minimum and maximum value in the sequence SS after performing the chosen operations (possibly none) by minSminS and maxSmaxS respectively. Similarly, let's denote the minimum and maximum value in TT after performing the chosen operations by minTminT and maxTmaxT respectively. The goal is minimizing the expression (maxS+maxT)−(minS+minT)(maxS+maxT)−(minS+minT). Compute the minimum value of this expression. 
Input

The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers NN, MM and xx.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers S1,S2…SNS1,S2…SN.
The third line contains MM space-separated integers T1,T2…TMT1,T2…TM.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the minimum possible value of the expression (maxS+maxT)−(minS+minT)(maxS+maxT)−(minS+minT).

Explanation
We can perform these two operations:

decrease S2S2 and T1T1 by xx
decrease S2S2 and T2T2 by xx

Afterwards, the sequence SS will be [1,2][1,2] and the sequence TT will be [−1,0][−1,0]. The resulting value of the given expression is (2+0)−(1+(−1))=2(2+0)−(1+(−1))=2. It is impossible to obtain a smaller value no matter how many operations are performed.
