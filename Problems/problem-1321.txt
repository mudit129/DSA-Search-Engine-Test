Naruto will be given certain missions for which he will have to visit a particular village(target village). Obviously he will take the shortest path from his village (Village 11). On his way to the target village, all the villages he visits (except his home village), he needs to pay some tax, even for the target village. Naruto knows the tax, AiAi for each village. However, the tax for any village might change suddenly and this has confused Naruto. Thus he is seeking your help.
Each village has a number between 11 to NN (inclusive). They are connected by paths. The whole network of the village is in the form of a tree with its root being village 11 which is Naruto's home. 
You will be given QQ queries,  queries are of 22 type-

11 xx - find the total tax to be paid to visit village xx 
22 xx uu - increase the tax of village x by an amount uu

Note that Naruto might get a mission in his own village as well. In that case, it will be a taxless mission(tax=0).
Help Naruto to calculate tax for each of his missions.
Input:

First Line contains NN & QQ, the number of villages and number of queries.
Next N−1N−1 lines contain two space-separated integers aa and bb denoting that villages aa and bb are connected by a path.
Next line contains N integers A1,A2,A3,....,ANA1,A2,A3,....,AN where AiAi represents tax to visit the ithith village.
Next QQ lines follow, where each line can be of two types
First type is  11 xx 
Second type is 22 xx uu 

Output:
For each query of type 1,  print the total tax to be paid by naruto on his way to that village taking the shortest route.

EXPLANATION:
In the first query, tax is paid at village 2,32,3 and 44. Thus ans is 3+5+43+5+4. In second query, tax of village 22 increases to 1010. Thus in Query 33 the answer is 3+10+43+10+4.
