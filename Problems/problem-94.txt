You are at a party of NN people, where only one person is known to everyone. Such a person may be presentmay be present in the party, if yes, (s)he doesn’t know anyone at the party. Your task is to find the stranger(guest)stranger(guest) at the party.   
You will be given a square matrix MM where if an element of row ii and column jj  is set to 1 it means the ith person knows the jth person. You need to find the 1≤id≤N1≤id≤N of the guestguest if present, otherwise print −1−1.   
Input Format:
The first line of input contains an integer TT denoting the number of test cases. Then TT test cases follow. Each test case consist of 2 lines.

The first line of each test case contains an integer NN denoting the number of people at the party.   
Next NN lines contain N2N2 integers of the matrix MM, where each line contains NN integers.

Output Format:
For each test case, print the idid of the celebrity if present. Otherwise, print "-1".
Constraints:

1≤T≤501≤T≤50
2≤N≤30002≤N≤3000
M[i][j] = 0 or 1M[i][j] = 0 or 1
1≤id≤N1≤id≤N

Explanation:
For 1st test case, given matrix M as:
0 1 0
0 0 0
0 1 0
The first row denotes the connection for 1st person and similarly for others. It is clear from the matrix that the 1st person knows only 2nd person. Also 3rd person knows only the 2nd person.
Here, the 2nd person is the guest because every other person knows him and he doesn't knows anyone. Therefore, 22 is printed on a new line.
