Taeyeon has a large collection of NN pretty boxes (numbered 11 through NN). For each valid ii, the ii-th box has two attributes SiSi and PiPi, representing the size and beauty of the box respectively, and it can fit inside each box jj such that Si≤SjSi≤Sj. (Don't ask why a box can fit into another box with the same size.)
Yoona's birthday is coming very soon, so Taeyeon decided to give Yoona some boxes as birthday gifts. As it is not cool to gift empty boxes, Taeyeon decided to put boxes inside boxes. Specifically, Taeyeon wants to choose KK pairs of boxes (for some valid KK) and for each pair, put one box inside the other (if they have the same size, she can choose which box should be inside; otherwise, she puts the smaller box inside the bigger one). For each pair of boxes (i,j)(i,j) such that box ii is inside box jj, the beauty of this pair is Pj−PiPj−Pi, since Taeyeon would think the beauty of the inner box is wasted.
Unboxing boxes is very tiring, so it is possible that Yoona does not want many pairs of boxes, and Taeyeon does not know the ideal value of KK. Therefore, for each KK between 11 and ⌊N2⌋⌊N2⌋, you need to help Taeyeon find the maximum possible total beauty she could obtain using at most KK pairs of boxes (the maximum possible sum of beauties of these pairs).
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer NN.
NN lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers SiSi and PiPi.

Output
Print ⌊N2⌋⌊N2⌋ lines. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines should contain a single integer ― the maximum beauty for at most ii pairs.
