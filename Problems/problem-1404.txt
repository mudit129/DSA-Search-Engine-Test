"People find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right.” 
Professor Slughorn returned to Hogwarts as an Arithmetic teacher. For the entire year, he gave his students a sequence of NN numbers and told them to bring these numbers for each of his class. He took QQ classes in the entire year.
In each class, he gave them a number kk. He asked them to find the number of possible strictlystrictly increasingincreasing subsequencessubsequences in the given sequence such that the maximum element of this subsequence is at max kk. Since the count would be huge, therefore he asked them to return the answer MODMOD 109+7109+7.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains 2 integers NN and QQ.
Next line contains NN space-separated integers, a1a1, a2a2, ……, anan.
Next line contains QQ space-separated integer, denoting the value of kk for each class.

Output:
For each test case print QQ space-separated integer on a separate line representing the output to the above queries.

Sample Output:
6 1 13 3

EXPLANATION:
For kk = 4, there are 6 possible subsequences which are: {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {3, 4}, {2, 4}
