It's the 21st of June and Baba Ramdev is gearing up for the International Day of Yoga.
He has a huge crowd lined up outside his Ashram, but he will only allow as many people inside as can be accommodated in his yoga halls.
In this Ashram, there is an infinite supply of yoga mats, each of dimension l×bl×b. However, there are just NN yoga halls, the ithith of which has dimensions specified by Li×BiLi×Bi.
Baba Ramdev is particular about having all the yoga mats placed axis parallel to the hall, and in the same orientation, without overlap. 
Find the maximum number of people who can enter the ashram if each person who enters must be allotted a yoga mat inside some hall.
Input:

The first line contains two integers ll and bb, which specify the dimensions of a yoga mat.
The second line contains an integer NN, the number of yoga halls in the Ashram.
NN lines follow, the ithith of which contains LiLi and BiBi, which specify the dimensions of the ithith yoga hall.

Output:
Print the maximum number of people that can be accommodated inside the ashram.
