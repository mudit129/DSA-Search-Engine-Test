Knowing that Devdas was a coder and he was very fond of palindromic subsequences of a string, Chandramukhi decided to gift him the longest subsequence of Dev's favourite string S which is a palindrome.

Paaro somehow got to know Chandramukhi's plan and decided to do something more impressive. She wants to gift a subsequence of the string S, such that all subsequences of the given subsequence is a palindrome. As Paaro is not good with strings, she wants you to tell her how many such subsequences exist in the string S.

You can see the definition of subsequence and palindrome by clicking on the links.

As the answer may be very large, output it modulo 10^9+7.

 Input  
The first line contains the number of test cases.
Each test case contains of the single line having string S.
String S only consists of lowercase alphabets.

 Output  
For each test case output a single line containg the required answer.
 Constraints  
1 < T < 100
1 < |S| < 100

 Example  
 Input:  
2
abcd
aa
 Output:  
4
3

 Explanation  
In first test cases 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' are subsequences having all their subsequences as palindromes.
