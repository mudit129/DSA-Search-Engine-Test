In Chefland, there are NN cities (numbered 11 through NN) connected by N−1N−1 bidirectional roads. Each city has exactly one garden. For each valid ii, let's denote the population of the ii-th city by AiAi and the initial number of fruits in its garden by BiBi; also, at any time, let's denote the current number of fruits in its garden by FiFi (Fi=BiFi=Bi initially).
You are given a permutation PP of the integers 11 through NN. For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), during the ii-th of the next NN days, the people of the city PiPi do the following:

For each city jj which is reachable from the city PiPi (including the city PiPi itself), visit the city jj and consume min(APi,Fj)min(APi,Fj) fruits from the garden of the city jj; afterwards, FjFj decreases by min(APi,Fj)min(APi,Fj).
Return to the city PiPi and cut off all the roads that are connecting it to other cities, so that nobody can visit the city PiPi or visit any other city from their city if it requires passing through the city PiPi.

For each valid ii, let DiDi be the first day when the number of fruits in the ii-th city's garden becomes zero, or −1−1 if the fruits in its garden never end up all eaten. Find D1,D2,…,DND1,D2,…,DN.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
Each of the next N−1N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting that vertices uu and vv are connected by an edge.
The next line contains NN space-separated integers P1,P2,…,PNP1,P2,…,PN.
The next line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
The last line contains NN space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers D1,D2,…,DND1,D2,…,DN.

Explanation
Example case 1: The process is as follows:

On day 11, people from city 11 eat 11 fruit from each garden. Afterwards, there are [0,2,5][0,2,5] fruits in the gardens of cities [1,2,3][1,2,3] respectively, so the answer for city 11 is 11, since the number of fruits in this garden becomes zero on day 11.
Then, on day 22, people from city 22 eat 22 fruits from each of the gardens in cities 22 and 33. Afterwards, there are 00 fruits in the garden of city 22 (so the answer for city 22 is 22, since the number of fruits in this garden becomes zero on this day) and 33 fruits in the garden of city 33.
Finally, on day 33, people from city 33 eat 33 fruits from the garden of city 33, so the answer for city 33 is 33.
