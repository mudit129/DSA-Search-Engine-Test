Abdullah has invented a machine for converting money. When XX units of money are inserted into this machine, it produces Reverse(X)Reverse(X) units of money. where Reverse(X)Reverse(X) denotes the decimal number obtained by reversing the decimal representation of XX (without leading zeroes). For example:

Reverse(123)=321Reverse(123)=321, since the reverse of "123" is "321"
Reverse(460)=64Reverse(460)=64, since the reverse of "460" is "064", which is 6464 in decimal representation

The machine is highly unstable and it can be used only once. Abdullah has NN units of money, so he is wondering: how much money should he insert into the machine such that the amount of money produced by the machine is maximum possible? The amount of money inserted into the machine must be an integer between 11 and NN inclusive.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer NN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the amount of money Abdullah should insert into the machine.

Explanation
Example case 1: Inserting X=19X=19 units of money gives Abdullah 9191 units of money.
Example case 2: Inserting X=7X=7 units of money gives Abdullah 77 units of money.
