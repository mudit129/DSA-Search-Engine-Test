A permutation p1,p2...pNp1,p2...pN of {1,2,...,N}{1,2,...,N} is beautiful if pi&pi+1pi&pi+1 is greater than 0 for every 1≤i<N1≤i<N . You are given an integer NN, and your task is toconstruct a beautiful permutation of length NN or determine that it's impossible.
Note that a&ba&b denotes the bitwise AND of aa and bb.
Input:
First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains a single line of input, an integer NN.
Output:
For each test case output −1−1 if there is no suitable permutation of length NN, otherwise output NN integers in a single line which form a beautiful permutation. If there are multiple answers output any of them.
Constraints

1≤N≤1051≤N≤105
The sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 106106
