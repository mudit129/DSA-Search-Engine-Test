Tanya still loves cats, even after all the sufferings she's been through because of them. After rigorously training the batch, it's now time to fit them into the squad. The chosen rookie cats are now to become officers! It's a day of celebration for NCPD, and without any doubt, the most happy person today is Tanya. After all, she is the one who took all the pains to train all of the rookies and transformed them into skilled cats for NCPD, that really is a lot of hard work on her part, so kudos to her for that!
Now, there are NN officers currently in the squad, and Tanya has trained a total of QQ rookie cats which have to be accommodated into the squad. At NCPD, each cat is assigned an integer ID, which describes the worthiness of a cat, greater is better. The NN cats already in the squad have IDs described by the sequence AA.
Although Tanya is the one who has worked the hardest to train these QQ cats, but she respects the amount of efforts put by all of her trainees. And out of joy, she has decided to gift rewards to her trainees. There are a total of QQ rounds, and in each round a cat with an ID has to be accommodated into AA. This is how the accommodation process happens for each cat at NCPD:

Tanya gifts a non-negative integer reward to this cat. The amount of reward is actually the number of cats already in AA which have a worthiness strictly lesser than this cat.
This cat gets added into AA at the last position.

Can you help Tanya figure out the total amount of rewards that she needs to have in order to give it to her loved trainees?
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN.
The second line contains NN space separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
The third line contains an integer QQ
Each of the next QQ lines contain an integer XX (X=W⊕R)(X=W⊕R), where XX is the bitwise XOR of the worthiness WW of the current cat entering into the squad and the amount of rewards RR given so far (excluding the current cat's reward).

Output:
For each test case print a single line containing a single integer, the total amount of reward Tanya needs to give.

Sample Output:

Explanation:

Example Case 1: Each of the QQ accommodations can be seen as follows:
A=[1,2,3,4,5], X=6⊕0=6A=[1,2,3,4,5], X=6⊕0=6
A=[1,2,3,4,5,6], X=7⊕5=2A=[1,2,3,4,5,6], X=7⊕5=2
A=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7], X=8⊕11=3A=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7], X=8⊕11=3
A=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], X=9⊕18=27A=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], X=9⊕18=27
A=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], X=10⊕26=16A=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], X=10⊕26=16
Finally, AA becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10][1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] and total rewards given are 3535.
