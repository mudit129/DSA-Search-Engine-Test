A battle is going to begin in the kingdom of Airland. There are NN soldiers in the kingdom, numbered 11 through NN and standing in a circle in such a way that for each valid ii, the soldier directly to the right of the ii-th soldier is soldier i+1i+1, and the soldier directly to the right of the NN-th soldier is soldier 11.
Each soldier holds a sword and a shield. The sword is used to attack other soldiers and the shield is used to defend from attacks. Let's denote the attack value of the ii-th soldier's sword by aiai and the defense value of the ii-th soldier's shield by didi.
In the battle, each soldier picks one of the soldiers standing to his left and right, and attacks that soldier. The choices of the soldiers are completely independent, so each soldier can be attacked by the soldier to his left, by the soldier to his right (the power of such an attack is the attack value of the attacking soldier's sword), by both of them (then, the power of the resulting attack is the sum of the attack values of these soldiers' swords) or by nobody. A soldier remains alive if the defense value of his shield is strictly greater than the power with which he is attacked. Everyone attacks simultaneously and there is only one round of attacks. Each soldier that remains alive at the end is awarded a laurel.
The king of Airland likes these fights, so the host of the battle promised the king that he can pick one soldier and if the soldier he picks survives the battle, the king receives the shield of that soldier.
Chef is the deputy of the king and you want to help him pick a soldier for the king in such a way that the king receives the best shield (with the greatest defense value). However, if Chef picks a soldier and that soldier does not survive, Chef will be thrown in a snake pit. Therefore, it should be guaranteed that the chosen soldier will survive regardless of the decisions of the other soldiers.
Can you help Chef make the best choice and tell him the defense value of the shield which the king gets, or decide that he can be thrown in the snake pit no matter which soldier he picks?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aNa1,a2,…,aN.
The third line contains NN space-separated integers d1,d2,…,dNd1,d2,…,dN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the best defense value of the shield the king gets, or −1−1 if Chef can be thrown in the snake pit.

Explanation
Example case 1: Soldier 11 can be attacked by soldier 22 and/or soldier 44. If only soldier 22 attacks him, the power of the attack is 11. If only soldier 44 attacks him, the power of the attack is 11 again. If they attack together, the power of the attack is 22. In each of these cases, soldier 11 will live.
Soldier 22 can be attacked by soldier 33, with attack power 44. His shield has defense value 44, which is not enough, so in this case, soldier 22 would die. The best safe choice is soldier 11, with defense value 33.
Example case 2: No soldier is guaranteed to survive the battle, so the answer is −1−1.
