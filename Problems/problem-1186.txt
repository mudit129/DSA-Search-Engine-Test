One day Chef and Alice tried a new way to make their messages encrypted. When they had to write something, firstly Chef wrote the message vertically in a matrix of NN Columns.
For example when they had to write "helloalicehowareyou" Chef wrote it like…
 h a h e
 e l o y
 l i w o
 l c a u
 o e r a

If all the letters of the sentence were not sufficient to form a matrix they included extra letters at the end of the sentence to complete a matrix(here 'a' is extra letter included to complete the matrix).
Then Alice wrote the letters of each row in a single row in left to right manner to finally encrypt the message.
The encrypted message is "haheeloyliwolcauoera""haheeloyliwolcauoera".
Now, your task is to decrypt the message encrypted by Chef and Alice.
Input:

The first line of input contains an Integer TT denoting the number of Test Cases, Description of Test cases follows
The First line of each test case contains an Integer NN Denoting the Number of Columns used to encrypt the message.
The Second line of each test case contains a string SS as the encrypted message.

Note:Note: The String contains lower case alphabets only. 
Output:
You have to output a single line containing the Decrypted string.
