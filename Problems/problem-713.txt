Chefland is a country with NN cities (numbered 11 through NN) connected by MM bidirectional roads. Chef is on a mission to spread a secret recipe of a Rogan Josh dish. Chef has a sequence A1,A2,…,AKA1,A2,…,AK and he must visit cities in the following way: he starts in the city A1A1, travels to the city A2A2, then travels from there to the city A3A3 and so on until he reaches the city AKAK. Note that a city may appear in AA multiple times, but Ai≠Ai+1Ai≠Ai+1 for each valid ii. When travelling between two cities, Chef always follows one of the shortest paths between them (but not necessarily the same one if he travels between them again).
The government is trying to track which cities are targeted by Chef. However, they do not know the sequence AA. Instead, they have tracked Chef's movement as a sequence B1,B2,…,BLB1,B2,…,BL of cities visited by Chef during his mission. Formally, B1=A1B1=A1 is the city where Chef starts, then for each valid ii, he moves from the city BiBi to the city Bi+1Bi+1 using the direct road between them and finally, he ends his mission in the city BL=AKBL=AK; Chef's sequence AA is a subsequence of BB, since the sequence BB also contains all shortest paths which Chef followed. It is guaranteed that there is a direct road between cities BiBi and Bi+1Bi+1 for each valid ii.
Help the government of Chefland find the minimum possible number of targeted cities, i.e. the minimum possible value of KK for a sequence AA that corresponds to the given sequence BB, or determine that no such sequence AA exists.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, MM and LL.
The second line contains LL space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BLB1,B2,…,BL.
Each of the following MM lines contains three space-separated integers uu, vv and ww describing a road between cities uu and vv with length ww.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum possible KK, or −1−1 if a valid sequence AA does not exist.
