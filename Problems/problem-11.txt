You are given an array of NN integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and three more integers X,p,X,p, and kk.
An operation on the array is defined to be: replace the kk-th smallest integer in the array with any integer you want.
Output the minimum number of operations you must perform on the array (possibly 00 operations) to make the pp-th smallest  element of the array equal to XX. If it is impossible to do so output −1−1.
Note: the kk-th smallest number in an array is the kk-th number from the left when the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains four integers N,X,p,kN,X,p,k respectively.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum number of operations you must perform to make XX the pp-th smallest element or −1−1 if its impossible to do so.

Explanation
Example case 1:

We can perform one operation in the array. Take the kk-th smallest integer of the current array (which is 88 in this case) and replace it with 00. The array then becomes [4,9,7,0,0][4,9,7,0,0] which now makes 44 as the 3rd smallest number of the array.

Example case 2:

It is impossible to make 2525 as the smallest number of the array.
