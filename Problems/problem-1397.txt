Chef has a circular array AA of NN integers A1,A2…ANA1,A2…AN where ANAN and A1A1 are considered adjacent. 
The subarray Ai,jAi,j defined as an array formed using elements of AA from ithith index element to jthjth index element (both inclusive). Formally, Ai,jAi,j is defined as:

If i≤ji≤j, then the subarray of AA from the index ii to index jj, both inclusive.
If i>ji>j, then it denotes the subarray of AA from index ii to index NN, followed by subarray of AA from index 11 to index jj.

A function f(B)f(B) is defined on an array BB as the number of subarrays of BB which have sum less than KK.
Let S=∑Ni=1∑Nj=1f(Ai,j)S=∑i=1N∑j=1Nf(Ai,j). Find the value of SS modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,007.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers NN and KK.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output:
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the value of SS modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,007.

Explanation
In the second test case, the array is [1,−1][1,−1] and K=1K=1.
f(A1,1)=0f(A1,1)=0
f(A1,2)=2f(A1,2)=2, because both the subarrays [1,−1][1,−1] and [−1][−1] have sum <K<K.
f(A2,1)=2f(A2,1)=2, because the array we are considering now is [−1,1][−1,1], and both the subarrays [1,−1][1,−1] and [−1][−1] have sum <K<K.
f(A2,2)=1f(A2,2)=1
The sum of these is 5, which is the answer.
