You are given NN non-negative integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. You are allowed to perform following operation any number of times:

Choose any valid index ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N) and a positive integer M>0M>0 and replace AiAi with AimodMAimodM. That is, replace AiAi with its remainder when divided by MM, which is a value between 00 and M−1M−1, inclusive. 
MM does not need to be same between different operations.

Find the minimum number of operations to make all the array elements equal.
Note: Since the input and output are large, prefer using fast input-output methods.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer TT - the number of test cases. Then TT test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN - the size of array.
The second line contains NN integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN - the elements of the array.

Output Format
For each test, print one line containing an integer which denotes minimum number of operations performed to make all the elements equal.
Constraints

1≤T≤1041≤T≤104
1≤N≤1051≤N≤105
0≤Ai≤2⋅1090≤Ai≤2⋅109
It is guaranteed that the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 106106.

Explanation
In first test case, we can make all the elements equal by following operations:

Take i=1i=1 and M=2M=2 and do A1:=A1mod2=0A1:=A1mod2=0.
Take i=2i=2 and M=1M=1 and do A2:=A2mod1=0A2:=A2mod1=0.
Take i=3i=3 and M=3M=3 and do A3:=A3mod3=0A3:=A3mod3=0.
After these 33 operations we have all the elements equal to zero.

In second test case, we can perform following operation: 

Choose i=3i=3 and M=2M=2 and do A3:=A3mod2=1A3:=A3mod2=1.
After this operation all the elements are 11.
