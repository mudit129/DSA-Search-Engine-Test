Abhishek is working in one of the best telecommunication companies of the world. He joined this company recently. To test his skills, his boss assigned him to help two of their customers: Aryan and Ali. 
Initially both of their phone numbers are empty (fantasy world you see). During each day , one of the following things can take place:

Last digit of numbers of either Aryan or Ali can be erased.
A new digit can be appended at the end of the numbers of either Aryan or Ali.

The company also has a magical number MM of length NN, where each digit is between 00 and 99 (both inclusive). The positions of digits are numbered from 11 to NN, from left to right. Aryan and Ali will be happy if both of their numbers appear as non-overlapping subsequences of MM.
More formally, suppose that Aryan chooses some positions from MM such that the digits at those positions form his current number (in the same order).Let the positions be a1,a2,a3,...,apa1,a2,a3,...,ap . Now , Ali chooses some positions, not already chosen by Aryan such that the digits at those positions form his current number (in the same order).Let the positions be b1,b2,b3,...,bqb1,b2,b3,...,bq. Then the following conditions should hold true :

aiai as well as bibi are strictly increasing sequences.
For all pairs (ai,bj)(ai,bj) 1≤i≤p1≤i≤p, 1≤j≤q1≤j≤q, ai≠bjai≠bj.
Values of aiai  are pairwise distinct. 1≤i≤p1≤i≤p.
Values of bibi  are pairwise distinct. 1≤i≤q1≤i≤q.
Ma1Ma2Ma3....MapMa1Ma2Ma3....Map forms Aryan's number.
Mb1Mb2Mb3....MbqMb1Mb2Mb3....Mbq forms Ali's number.

Over a period of DD days, Abhishek has to follow one of the following instructions each day:

appendappend xx yy : You have to append digit yy to the end of xx's number.
eraseerase xx : Erase the last digit from xx's number. 

Abhishek has to help these customers over a period of DD days. As he is a new employee, he asks for your help.
For each of the DD days, you have to tell whether the phone numbers of Aryan and Ali appear as non-overlapping subsequences of MM.
NOTE : Prefer using fast I/O methods, as the input is large.
Input Format

First line will contain two spaced integers NN , DD
The next line will contain the magical number MM of length NN
DD lines follow. Each of these lines will contain either of the following:
appendappend xx yy : You have to append digit yy to the end of xx's number.
eraseerase xx : Erase the last digit from xx's number. 

Output Format

Print DD lines. On the ithith line, print "YES" (without quotes) if both Aryan and Ali will be happy after the ithith day otherwise print "NO" (without quotes). You can print any character of the answer in any case, ie "yes", "YeS", "nO","No" etc will be considered valid response. 

Constraints

1≤N≤5⋅1051≤N≤5⋅105
1≤D≤5⋅1041≤D≤5⋅104
The length of numbers of Aryan and Ali does not exceed 103103 
MM consists of digits from 00 to 99.
xx is either Aryan or Ali.
yy can be any digit from 00 to 99.
During the erase operation, the corresponding person's number is non empty.
The numbers of Aryan, Ali and even the magical number MM can contain leading zeroes.

Explanation

At the end of first day, Aryan's number is 11 , while Ali's number is empty. Since 11 can be obtained as a subsequence of MM, Aryan is happy. Ali is also happy(as his number is empty).
At the end of second day, numbers of Aryan and Ali are 11 and 00 respectively. Aryan can choose the subsequence formed by the digit at position 33 while Ali can choose the digit at position 11 . Since these are distinct positions , both will be happy.
At the end of third day, numbers of Aryan and Ali are 11 and 0303 respectively. Aryan can choose the same position as before, while Ali can choose positions 11 and 44. As these are distinct positions, both will be happy.
At the end of forth day, numbers of Aryan and Ali are 1919 and 0303 respectively. Since Aryan cannot choose any subsequence , he will be unhappy (Ali still being happy).
