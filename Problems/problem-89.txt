The range of an array is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum value in it.
Chef comes up with a crazy idea to minimize the range by changing atmost 33 elements in the array. He wants to check whether the minimum range he gets is right or not.
Please help him in verifying his answer.
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
First line of each test case contains an integer NN, the no. of integers in the array.
Second line contains NN space separated integers, A0,A1,...,An−1A0,A1,...,An−1. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line, the minimum range.
Constraints

1≤T≤101≤T≤10
3≤N≤1053≤N≤105
−109≤Ai≤109−109≤Ai≤109

Sample Input:
1
6
3 5 0 2 10 0

Sample Output:
2

EXPLANATION:
Chef changes the elements 33, 55 and 1010 to 00, 11 and 22, resulting in the array: [00, 11, 00, 22, 22, 00].
The minimum range is 2−0=22−0=2. There can be multiple ways to change atmost 33 elements to get the answer.
