Chef's friend Igzi is often at the coding gym, working out his mind muscles. When he is there, he asks Chef to guard his most prized posession: a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. Initially, for each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), Ai=iAi=i held. However, Chef sometimes gets bored and starts playing with the sequence. Since NN can be very large, Chef has a lot of fun with it and he would like to share it with you.
You should process QQ queries of two types:

1 x: set Ax=0Ax=0
2 l r: find the maximum element in the subsequence Al,Al+1,…,ArAl,Al+1,…,Ar

Since Chef does not want to make Igzi angry, the queries are encoded so that they have to be processed online:

For each query, let's denote the sum of answers to all previous queries of type 2, modulo NN, by ss. (Initially, s=0s=0.)
For each query of the first type, you are given an integer yy. You can compute xx as y+sy+s.
For each query of the second type, you are given two integers pp and qq. You can compute ll as p+sp+s and rr as q+sq+s.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ.
The following QQ lines describe queries.
Each of these lines starts with an integer tt denoting the type of the current query: t=1t=1 for a query of the first type or t=2t=2 for a query of the second type.
For a query of the first type, it is followed by a space and an integer yy.
For a query of the second type, it is followed by a space and two space-separated integers pp and qq.

Output
For each query of the second type, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum of the given subsequence.

Explanation

Query 1: l=2l=2, r=5r=5. The maximum element of the subsequence A2,A3,A4,A5A2,A3,A4,A5 is A5=5A5=5. After this query, ss becomes 5%7=55%7=5.
Query 2: x=5x=5. A5A5 becomes 00.
Query 3: l=2l=2, r=5r=5. The maximum element of the same subsequence is now A4=4A4=4; ss becomes (5+4)%7=2(5+4)%7=2.
Query 4: x=3x=3, A3A3 becomes 00.
Query 5: l=2l=2, r=5r=5. The maximum element of the same subsequence is still A4=4A4=4; ss becomes (5+4+4)%7=6(5+4+4)%7=6.
Query 6: x=2x=2, A2A2 becomes 00.
Query 7: x=4x=4, A4A4 becomes 00.
Query 8: l=2l=2, r=5r=5. All elements of the same subsequence as before are 00, so the maximum is 00; ss becomes (5+4+4+0)%7=6(5+4+4+0)%7=6.
Query 9: l=1l=1, r=3r=3. The maximum of the subsequence A1,A2,A3A1,A2,A3 is A1=1A1=1; ss becomes (5+4+4+0+1)%7=0(5+4+4+0+1)%7=0.
