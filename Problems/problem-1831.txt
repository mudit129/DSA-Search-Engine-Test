Let PP be a polynomial in nn variables given by:
P(x1,x2,…,xn)=(k+x1+x2+⋯+xn)mP(x1,x2,…,xn)=(k+x1+x2+⋯+xn)m
Here n, k and m are positive integers. Find the sum of all coefficients of the terms of the polynomial which have even powers in each of the n variables and output it modulo 109+7.
Note that the constant term's coefficient is also included in the sum. Please see the sample IO and Explanation for details.
Input:

First line will contain the number of testcases T
Each testcase will consist of single line with 3 positive integers n, k and m in that order

Explanation:

For the first testcase, the given polynomial is (1+x1+x2)2 which can be expanded as: 1+x21+x22+2x1+2x2+2x1x2
The terms with even power in all variables are 1, x21 and x22. The sum of their coefficients is 1+1+1=3.
For the second testcase, the given polynomial is (3+x1+x2+x3)2 which can be expanded as: 2x1x2+2x1x3+6x1+x21+6x2+x22+6x3+2x2x3+x23+9
The terms with even power in all variables are x21, x22, x23 and 9. The sum of their coefficients is 1+1+1+9=12.
For the third testcase, the given polynomial is (5+x1+x2)4 which can be expanded as: 625+500x1+150x21+20x31+x41+500x2+300x1x2+60x21x2+4x31x2+150x22+60x1x22+6x21x22+20x32+4x1x32+x42
The terms with even power in all variables are 625, 150x21, x41, 150x22, 6x21x22 and x42. The sum of their coefficients is 625+150+1+150+6+1=933
