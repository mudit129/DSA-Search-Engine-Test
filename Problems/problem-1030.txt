You are given NN binary strings of length NN each. You need to find a binary string of length NN which is different from all of the given strings.
Note:

A binary string is defined as a string consisting only of '0' and '1'.
A string is considered different from another string when they have different lengths, or when they differ in at least one position.

Input Format

The first line will contain TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains NN  - the number of strings and length of strings.
Each of the next NN lines contains a binary string of length NN.

Output Format
For each test case, print on one line a binary string of length NN, which is different from all of the given strings. If there are multiple possible answers, print any.
