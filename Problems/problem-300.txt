Chef Ada is building a new restaurant in the following way:

First, NN points X1,X2,…,XNX1,X2,…,XN are chosen on the xx-axis.
Then, NN columns (numbered 11 through NN) are made. For simplicity, the columns are represented as vertical segments; for each valid ii, the height of the ii-th segment is HiHi.
Ada assigns a column to each of the points X1,X2,…,XNX1,X2,…,XN in an arbitrary way (each column must be assigned to exactly one point).
Finally, Ada constructs the roof of the restaurant, represented by a polyline with NN vertices. Let's denote the column assigned to the ii-th point by PiPi. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these vertices is (Xi,HPi)(Xi,HPi), i.e. the polyline joins the tops of the columns from left to right.

Ada wants the biggest restaurant. Help her choose the positions of the columns in such a way that the area below the roof is the biggest possible. Formally, she wants to maximise the area of the polygon whose perimeter is formed by the roof and the segments (XN,HPN)−(XN,0)−(X1,0)−(X1,HP1)(XN,HPN)−(XN,0)−(X1,0)−(X1,HP1). Let SS be this maximum area; you should compute 2⋅S2⋅S (it is guaranteed that 2⋅S2⋅S is an integer).
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
NN lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers XiXi and HiHi.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer 2⋅S2⋅S.
