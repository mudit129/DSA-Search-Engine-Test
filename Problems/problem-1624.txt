Alice has recently learned in her economics class that the market is said to be in equilibrium when the supply is equal to the demand.
Alice has market data for NN time points in the form of two integer arrays SS and DD. Here, SiSi denotes the supply at the ithith point of time and DiDi denotes the demand at the ithith point of time, for each 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N.
Help Alice in finding out the number of time points at which the market was in equilibrium. 
Input Format

The first line of input will contain an integer TT — the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
Each test case contains three lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN, the length of the arrays SS and DD.
The second line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers S1,S2,…,SNS1,S2,…,SN.
The third line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers D1,D2,…,DND1,D2,…,DN. 

Output Format
For each test case, output the number of time points at which the market was in equilibrium.

Explanation
Test case 11: For i=3i=3 and i=4i=4, we have supply equal to demand, hence the market is in equilibrium.
Test case 22: For i=1i=1, we have supply equal to demand, hence the market is in equilibrium.
