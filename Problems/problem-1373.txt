Alice and Bob are playing a game.
First, Alice throws NN darts at a board with dimensions 109×109109×109 at random. Each dart hits the board at a point (some of these points may coincide). Then, Bob should answer Alice's QQ questions. In each question, Alice chooses two integers ll and rr; Bob should only consider all points hit in throws ll through rr (inclusive) and compute the distance between the farthest pair of these points.
Help Bob find the answers to all queries.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer NN denoting the number of points.
NN lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers xixi and yiyi denoting the coordinates of the point hit with the ii-th dart.
The next line contains a single integer QQ denoting the number of queries.
Each of the following QQ lines contains two space-separated integers ll and rr describing one query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the square of the maximum distance. (It is guaranteed that this number is an integer.)
