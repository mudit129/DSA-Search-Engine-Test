Explanation
Test case 11:

Chef will buy 1616 Fuljhari's and 44 Anar's which in total costs him 16⋅5+4⋅5=10016⋅5+4⋅5=100 rupees. 
Next, he uses 1616 Fuljhari's to light 164=4164=4 Anar's. 
Since all the Fuljhari's are over, he can't light up any Chakri's.
So in total, he is able to light up 4+0=44+0=4 Anar's and Chakri's.
There is no other allocation giving a better answer than this.

Test case 22:

Chef will buy 44 Fuljhari's, 22 Anar's and 22 Chakri's which in total costs him 4⋅2+2⋅2+2⋅2=164⋅2+2⋅2+2⋅2=16 rupees. 
Next, he uses 22 Fuljhari's to light 21=221=2 Anar's. 
Next, he uses 22 Fuljhari's to light 21=221=2 Chakri's. 
So in total, he is able to light up 2+2=42+2=4 Anar's and Chakri's.
The other possible allocation could be buying 44 Fuljhari's, 33 Anar's, and 11 Chakri.
