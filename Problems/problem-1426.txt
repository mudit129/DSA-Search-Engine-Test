You have given a string SS of lenght NN consisting of only lowercase english letters.       
Let F(S) =  no of unique palindromic substrings in SS 
You need to minimize F(s) by doing following operation exactly once.
Choose a index i and replace SiSi with 0.                
Find the minimum value of F(S) and also find the index which gives minimum value of F(S) . If there are multiple indices which give minimum value of F(S). Then print the largest index.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.       
Next  Line contains a single integer NN.            
Next Line contains a string SS.

Output:
For each testcase print two values Minimum value of F(X) , largest index which gives this Minimum value.
Constraints

1≤T≤101≤T≤10
2≤N≤1052≤N≤105 
S contains only lowercase english letters

Sample Input:
1
3

aaa
Sample Output:
3 3

EXPLANATION:
Operation 1 : S1S1 = 0 then S = "0aa"
No of unique palindromes substrings in S = [ 0 , a, aa]
F(S) = 3            
Operation 2 : S2S2 = 0 then S = "a0a"
No of unique palindromes substrings in S = [ 0 , a, a0a]
F(S) = 3
Operation 3 : S3S3 = 0 then S = "aa0"
No of unique palindromes substrings in S = [ 0 , a, aa]
F(S) = 3        
All above 3 operations gives F(S) = 3 but index = 3  is the largest index which gives F(X) = 3
