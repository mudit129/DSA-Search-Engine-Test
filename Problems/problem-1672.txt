Chef bought an electronic board and pen. He wants to use them to record his clients' signatures.
The board is a grid with NN rows (numbered 11 through NN) and MM columns (numbered 11 through MM) of pixels. Initially, all pixels are white. A client uses the electronic pen to sign on the board; whenever the pen touches a pixel, this pixel becomes black. Note that a signature may be non-continuous (a client may lift the pen while signing).
Chef stores a typical signature of his current client as a matrix of characters Ai,jAi,j, where for each valid ii and jj, Ai,jAi,j is either '1' (if the cell in the ii-th row and jj-th column is black) or '0' (if this cell is white). The client just signed on the board; this signature is stored in the same form as a matrix Bi,jBi,j. Chef wants to know how close this signature is to this client's typical signature.
Two signatures are considered the same if it is possible to choose (possibly negative) integers drdr and dcdc such that for each 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N and 1≤j≤M1≤j≤M, Ai,j=Bi+dr,j+dcAi,j=Bi+dr,j+dc. Here, if Bi+dr,j+dcBi+dr,j+dc does not correspond to a valid cell, it is considered to be '0'.
To compare the signatures, the colours of zero or more cells must be flipped in such a way that the signatures become the same (each flipped cell may be in any matrix). The error in the client's current signature is the minimum number of cells whose colours must be flipped. Find the error in the signature.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.
NN lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains a string with length MM describing the ii-th row of the matrix AA.
NN more lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains a string with length MM describing the ii-th row of the matrix BB.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the error in the current signature.
