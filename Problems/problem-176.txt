Chef is going to start playing Fantasy Football League (FFL) this season. In FFL, each team consists of exactly 1515 players: 22 goalkeepers, 55 defenders, 55 midfielders and 33 forwards. Chef has already bought 1313 players; he is only missing one defender and one forward.
There are NN available players (numbered 11 through NN). For each valid ii, the ii-th player is either a defender or a forward and has a price PiPi. The sum of prices of all players in a team must not exceed 100100 dollars and the players Chef bought already cost him SS dollars.
Can you help Chef determine if he can complete the team by buying one defender and one forward in such a way that he does not exceed the total price limit?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and SS.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers P1,P2,…,PNP1,P2,…,PN.
The last line contains NN space-separated integers. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these integers is 00 if the ii-th player is a defender or 11 if the ii-th player is a forward.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "yes" if it is possible to build a complete team or "no" otherwise (without quotes).

yes
no
Explanation
Example case 1: If Chef buys the 11-st and 33-rd player, the total price of his team is 90+9=9990+9=99, which is perfectly fine. There is no other valid way to pick two players.
Example case 2: Chef cannot buy two players in such a way that all conditions are satisfied.
