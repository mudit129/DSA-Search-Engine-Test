You are a warrior and you have to fight NN enemy warriors (numbered 11 through NN) one by one, in any order you choose. You have to win as many of these fights as possible.
Each warrior has some amount of power, which changes when the warrior fights. For each ii, the ii-th enemy warrior has power PiPi. When you have power xx and you fight an enemy warrior with power yy, the following happens:

if x>yx>y, you kill the enemy warrior and your power changes to 2(x−y)2(x−y)
otherwise (if x≤yx≤y), the enemy warrior kills you

You should answer QQ queries. In each query, you are given your initial power XX and you should find the maximum number of warriors you can kill if you are starting with power XX.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers P1,P2,…,PNP1,P2,…,PN.
QQ lines follow. Each of these lines contains a single integer XX describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum number of warriors you can kill.
