Recently a renowned scientist, Chef discovered a planet. Total trees on planet are NN and are denoted by XX and YY coordinates.
Chef defined strength of a tree of the planet as the number of distinct subsets of remaining trees whose convex hull can enclose the tree completely and strictly inside it. More formally, let S(x)S(x) be strength of tree xx, AA be any subset of given N−1N−1 trees (excluding the tree xx from NN trees) and HH be the convex hull of AA. Then,  
S(x)S(x) == Total number of subsets AA for which HH contains tree xx strictly inside it.
Sum of strengths of all trees is assumed to be the total strength of the planet. Chef has already calculated total strength of the planet, now he wants you to calculate the total strength just for verification. Chef knows that the total strength can be high so he wants you to calculate the total strength modulo 109109 ++ 77.  
Notes:Notes:
11. Consider the planet as a very large 22-Dimensional Plane.
22. All Trees have distinct coordinates and no three trees are collinear.    
Input Format:

1st1st line contains NN which denotes number of trees.
Following NN lines contains two integer XX and YY denoting the coordinates of ithith tree.

Output Format:

A single integer denoting the summation of all S(x)S(x) modulo 109109 ++ 77.

Constraints:

1≤N≤10001≤N≤1000 
−1000000≤x,y≤1000000−1000000≤x,y≤1000000 

Sample Input:

0 0
0 2
4 2
4 0
1 1  
Sample Output:
3  
Explanation:
Let A(0,0)A(0,0), B(0,2)B(0,2), C(4,0)C(4,0), D(4,2)D(4,2) and E(1,1)E(1,1). Subset ABCDABCD contains point EE inside. Subset ABCABC contains point EE inside. Subset ABDABD contains point EE inside it. Rest all other subsets do not contains any point inside them. Therefore, summation of S(x)S(x) == 33.
