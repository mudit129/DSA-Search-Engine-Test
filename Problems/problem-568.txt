Find the minimum integer KK such that sum of bits present on odd positions in binary representation of all integers from 11 to KK is greater than or equal to NN.
The bits are enumerated from left to right starting from the leftmost set bit i.e. the most significant bit. For example, binary representation of 7777 is 1001101. Bits present on 1st1st, 3rd3rd, 5th5th and 7th7th positions in the binary representation are 1,0,1,11,0,1,1 respectively. So sum of bits present on odd positions in binary representation of 7777 is 1+0+1+1=31+0+1+1=3.

Explanation

In the first test case, binary representations of 11 and 22 are 1, 10. Sum of bits present on odd positions in the binary representation of 11 and 22 =  1+11+1 = 22.
In the second test case, the binary representations of integers from 11 to 55 are 1, 10, 
11, 100, 101 respectively. So the sum of bits present on odd positions in binary 
representation of integers from 11 to 55 are 1,1,1,1,21,1,1,1,2 respectively which makes a total of 66.
