Chef is frustrated in this lockown. So to overcome this he plans to travel various mountains.
He is very strange so he sets some conditions for eacheach Type 2 query(mentioned below) (i.e. 11 ii) : 

Let Chef has travelled till ithith mountain from left to right.
He does not like to travel the mountain with the height ,of which he has travelled till now. More formally, 
Let the height of peak on which he is standing is aiai then he can only go to the peak of height ajaj 
which is greater than aiai and nearest to ithith mountain such that there should be no other peak of same height ajaj till aiai(height of ithith mountain) .

Input format:

The first line contains an integer TT denoting the number of test cases.
The second line of  consist of a integer NN and QQ .
The third line contains NN not necessarily distinct positive integers a0,a1,...,an−1a0,a1,...,an−1 denoting the height of 
NN mountains.
Then next QQ lines follows where each line consisting of eithereither of 22 types of queries:
Type 1:  00 AA BB i.e. aA=BaA=B (where height of AthAth mountain will be updated to BB) 
Type 2:  11 AA i.e. you have to answer akak which is greater than aAaA and nearest to AthAth mountain such that there should be no other peak of same height akak till aAaA(height of AthAth mountain) .

Output format:

For every query of Type 2 there should be an integer akak on next  line for the updated array , If no such akak exists then akak= −1−1 , as query of type 1 will have no output .
