You are given a rooted tree with NN nodes (numbered 11 through NN; node 11 is the root). For each ii (1≤i≤N−11≤i≤N−1), the parent of the node i+1i+1 is pipi.
You need to answer QQ queries. (Sounds quite familiar!) For each query, first, WW tasks are given to node VV. These tasks are processed in the tree in the following way:

When a node receives aa tasks and it has no children, all aa tasks are executed by this node.
Otherwise, i.e. if the node has K>0K>0 children, where KK is a divisor of aa, then this node gives a/Ka/K of these tasks to each of its children. This process is performed recursively by each child on the tasks it receives.
Otherwise, i.e. if the node has K>0K>0 children, but KK is not a divisor of aa, all aa tasks are ignored and none of this node's children receive any tasks.

For each query, find the number of tasks that are not executed, i.e. end up ignored, possibly after passing down the tree.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains N−1N−1 space-separated integers p1,p2,…,pN−1p1,p2,…,pN−1.
The third line contains a single integer QQ.
QQ lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers VV and WW describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of tasks that are not executed.
