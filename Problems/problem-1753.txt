Devu is learning Combinatorics in his college. He find it very interesting to calculate number of ways of going to point (c,d) from point (a,b) in co-ordinate plane. We can take horizontal and vertical steps only and can not visit at a point twice. In a step, you can move one unit only. We have to reach to the point (c,d) from the point (a,b) using abs(a-c)+ abs(b-d) steps only.

 
Devu has two sets of points. Set A contains points having X co-ordinate 0 and Y co-ordinates varying from 1 to N(both inclusive). Set B contains points having X co-ordinate K and Y co-ordinates varying from 1 to N(both inclusive).  Both sets contains N number of integral points. He wants to calculate the sum of number of ways to going to the each point of set B from the each point of set A .
As the answer can be large, print it modulo 1000000007.

Input

First line of input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases.  
 Next T lines will contain pair of integers N and K
Output
For each test case, print a single integer representing the answer of that test case.

Constraints

Subtask #1: 10 points

1 ≤ T  ≤ 20, 1 ≤ N ,K ≤ 1000

Subtask #1: 10 points

1 ≤ T  ≤ 20, 1 ≤ N ,K ≤ 106

Subtask #3: 80 points

1 ≤ T  ≤ 10000, 1 ≤ N,K  ≤ 106

                        Sample Input 1

                        Sample Output 1
                        

8
236
Explanation

For the first sample case,
ways[(0,1)->(2,1)]= 1
ways[(0,2)->(2,2)]= 1
ways[(0,1)->(2,2)]= 3
ways[(0,2)->(2,1)]= 3
So, the total number of ways = 8.
