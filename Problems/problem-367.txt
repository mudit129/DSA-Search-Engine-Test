You are given a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. Consider every pair that consists of:
1)1) One of the longest non-decreasing subsequences of AA.
2)2) One of the longest non-increasing subsequences of AA. 
Find the maximum possible length of the longest common subsequence of the two sequences in such a pair.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum possible length of the longest common subsequence of any longest non-decreasing subsequence of AA and any longest non-increasing subsequence of AA.

Explanation
Example case 1: No pair of subsequences, containing one of the longest non-decreasing subsequences and one of longest non-increasing subsequences have a number in common. Hence, the answer is 00.
Example case 2: The maximum length of the longest common subsequence is 11 and it can be achieved by choosing the longest non-decreasing subsequence {1,2,3,4}{1,2,3,4} and the longest non-increasing subsequence {6,5,2}{6,5,2}. The longest common subsequence of those two subsequences is {2}{2}.
Example case 3: The maximum length of the longest common subsequence is 33 and it can be achieved by choosing the longest non-decreasing subsequence {2,3,3,3,7}{2,3,3,3,7} and the longest non-increasing subsequence {5,3,3,3}{5,3,3,3}. The longest common subsequence of those two subsequences is {3,3,3}{3,3,3}.
Example case 4: The maximum length of the longest common subsequence is 22 and it can be achieved by choosing the longest non-decreasing subsequence {1,4,4,5}{1,4,4,5} and the longest non-increasing subsequence {6,4,4}{6,4,4}. The longest common subsequence of those two subsequences is {4,4}{4,4}.
