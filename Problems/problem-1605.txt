Explanation
Test Case 11: There are 22 bikes and 11 car. Each bike has 22 tyres, so there are 2⋅2=42⋅2=4 bike tyres. Similarly, each car has 44 tyres, so there are 1⋅4=41⋅4=4 car tyres. Adding the tyres of all vehicles, we get 4+4=84+4=8 tyres in total.
Test Case 22: There are 33 bikes and 00 cars. Each bike has 22 tyres, so there are 3⋅2=63⋅2=6 bike tyres. There are no cars, so there are 0⋅4=00⋅4=0 car tyres. Adding the tyres of all vehicles, we get 6+0=66+0=6 tyres in total.
