Chefina  is  always interested to play with string. But due to exam pressure she has no time to solve a string problem. She wants your help. Can you help her to solve that problem?
You are given a string. You have to find out the WonderWonder SumSum of the string. WonderWonder SumSum of a string is defined as the sum of the value of each character of the string. 
The value of each character means:

If the string is started with "a" , then the value of each character of the string is like "a"=100, "b"=101, "c"="102" ………"z"=125.
If the string is started with "z" , then the value of each character of the string is like "a"=2600, "b"=2601, "c"="2602" ………"z"=2625.

Since even the WonderWonder SumSum can be large, output WonderWonder SumSum modulo  (109+7109+7).
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, a string SS with lower case alphabet 
only.

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line integer i.e.  WonderWonder SumSum modulo  (109+7109+7).
Constraints

1≤T≤10001≤T≤1000
1≤|S|≤1051≤|S|≤105

Sample Input:
22
cabcab

sdefsdef
Sample Output:
903903

76307630
EXPLANATION:
i) For the first test case, since the string is started with "cc", so output is (302302+300300+301301)=903903
ii)For the second test case, since the string is started with "ss", so output is (19181918+19031903+19041904+19051905)=76307630
