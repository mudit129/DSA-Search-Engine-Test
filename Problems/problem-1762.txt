Adreja was bored of playing PUBG and asked her grandfather Aurobindo for assigning her any interesting task. Being a Bengali, Aurobindo said “Code Koroo Naaa….” (which means do coding). She then decided to write a code for generating random strings containing uppercase and lowercase English alphabets (i.e. a−zA−Z).
She wrote the code and generated N strings randomly using her code and showed them to Aurobindo. Aurobindo was impressed by her coding abilities, so he gifted her a plate of rosogolla. Her younger brother Nishit also wanted to have rosogolla from Aurobindo. To impress Aurobindo, Nishit decided to tell him which string is palindrome. But, Nishit has learnt about the English alphabets recently, and knows the lowercase representations of all alphabets, but he knows uppercase representations of only K alphabets. Thus, he considers the other uppercase alphabets to be different alphabets from their lowercase representations. For Example, if he knows both the representations of only 1 alphabet, say ′m′, then he will consider ′m′ and ′M′ to be the same, but for other 25 alphabets he will consider both of its representations, like ′b′ and ′B′ as two different alphabets.
You are Adreja's best friend, and to test your coding abilities she has asked you to write a program that prints the probability that a string of given length generated by her code will be identified as a palindrome by Nishit. She further told you that it can be proved that the required probability can be represented in the form P/Q where P and Q are co-prime integers.Thus, she wants the required probability as P.Q−1mod(109+7), where Q−1 denotes the modular multiplicative inverse of Q(modulo (109+7)).
INPUT

First line of Input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains two integers N and K, denoting the total number of generated strings and the number of uppercase alphabets known to Nishit. N more lines follow.
ith line (1≤i≤N) contains a single integer Li representing the length of ith string.

OUTPUT

For each test case print N lines, here the ith line  (1≤i≤N) should contain single integer — the required probability for the ith string in the form specified by Adreja.

EXPLANATION
Example Case 1: Here N=2, so Adreja has generated 2 strings, and K=26, hence Nishit can match all lowercase alphabets to the corresponding uppercase alphabets.

First string is of length 1, and any string of length 1 is a palindrome, so the probability of string being a palindrome is 1.
Second string is of length 2. Adreja's code can generate 2704 different strings of length 2. Out of these 2704 strings, 104 will be identified as palindromes by Nishit.

Example Case 2: Here N=1, hence only 1 string has been generated.

For this string, the values of P and Q come out to be 27 and 1352 respectively, hence P.Q−1mod(109+7)=818786988
