You are given a weighted directed graph of NN vertices and N2N2 edges, and an array AA of length NN. Initially, every ordered pair of vertices (u,v)(u,v) is connected by a directed edge u→vu→v of cost AuAu (this also includes self-loops). 
Then there were MM changes in edges' weights such that the weight of the directed edge u→vu→v is now equal to cc. You are asked to find the sum of the lengths of the shortest paths over all ordered pairs of distinct vertices.
Input

The first line contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
The third line of each test case contains a single integer MM.
The next MM lines contain information about the changed edges in the uu vv cc format.

Output
For each test case, output the sum of the lengths of the shortest paths over all ordered pairs of vertices.

It is guaranteed that the weight of the edge u→vu→v was changed at most once.

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (8 points, time limit 1 second): The sum NN for all tests does not exceed 500500.
Subtask #2 (22 points, time limit 1 second): Each vertex belongs to at most one changed edge (in other words, the edges do not overlap).
Subtask #3 (30 points, time limit 1 second): The sum MM for all tests does not exceed 500500.
Subtask #4 (40 points, time limit 4.5 seconds): original constraints.

Explanation
Example case 1: The lengths of the shortest paths between vertices uu and vv are AuAu and the answer is 2⋅(2+4+1)=142⋅(2+4+1)=14.
Example case 2: The lengths of the shortest paths between the vertices uu and vv are equal to AuAu except for the pair of vertices (3,4)(3,4) for which the distance is 22.
