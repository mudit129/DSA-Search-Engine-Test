Chef has an inventory, which can be represented as a row of NN cells (numbered 11 through NN). Each cell is either empty or contains a box. Chef wants to rearrange the boxes in such a way that they are all on the left side of the inventory (so if there are KK boxes, they should occupy the leftmost KK cells). He may perform two types of moves:

choose a cell ii (1≤i≤N−21≤i≤N−2); if cells ii and i+2i+2 are empty and cell i+1i+1 contains a box, Chef stands in cell i+2i+2 and pushes the box from cell i+1i+1 to cell ii
choose a cell ii (1≤i≤N−21≤i≤N−2); if cells i+1i+1 and i+2i+2 are empty and cell ii contains a box, Chef stands in cell i+1i+1 and pulls the box in cell ii to cell i+1i+1

The moves may be performed in any order, any number of times (possibly zero).
Find the minimum number of moves required to get all boxes to the left side of the inventory or determine that it is impossible.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains a string with length NN describing the inventory. For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), the ii-th character of this string is '#' if the ii-th cell contains a box or '.' if the ii-th cell is empty.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of moves required, or −1−1 if it is impossible to move all boxes to the left.
Constraints

1≤T≤1001≤T≤100
3≤N≤1053≤N≤105
the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 106106
