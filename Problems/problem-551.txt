You are given two integer sequences A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN.
We define the similarity of the sequences AA and BB as the number of indices ii such that Ai=BiAi=Bi.
You should process QQ queries. In each query, you are given parameters ll, rr and cc; you should change each of the elements Al,Al+1,…,ArAl,Al+1,…,Ar to cc, and then compute the similarity of the sequences AA and BB.
Chef knows that this is simple, so he asks you to answer the queries online. Note that the input is given in a special format to ensure that.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
The third line contains NN space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN.
Each of the next QQ lines contains three space-separated integers xx, yy and zz describing a query in the following format:
Let's denote the similarity of AA and BB before this query by PrPr (for the first query, PrPr is the similarity of the initial sequences).
For this query, l=x⊕Prl=x⊕Pr, r=y⊕Prr=y⊕Pr and c=z⊕Prc=z⊕Pr.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the similarity after this query.

Explanation
Example case 1: The similarity before any query is applied is 22 (the sequences match at positions 11 and 33).
In the first query, l=2l=2, r=3r=3, c=2c=2. The similarity after this query is 11 (the only match is at position 11).
In the second query, l=1l=1, r=4r=4, c=2c=2. The similarity after this query is 00 (no match at any position).
In the third query, l=1l=1, r=4r=4, c=1c=1. The similarity after this query is 22 (two matches at positions 11 and 22).
