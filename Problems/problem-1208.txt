Ada has the biggest chessboard in ChefLand. It has NN rows (numbered 11 through NN) and MM columns (numbered 11 through MM), where M≥2NM≥2N. As training for her upcoming world chess championship match, she placed one bishop at row rr and column cc of her board. The remaining squares of the board are empty. Now, she is calculating the number of squares that can be reached by the bishop in at most KK moves. Help Ada verify her answers.
Remember that in one move, a bishop at row rr and column cc can move to another square at row r′r′ and column c′c′ if and only if either r+c=r′+c′r+c=r′+c′ or r−c=r′−c′r−c=r′−c′.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated integers NN, MM, rr, cc and KK.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of reachable squares.
