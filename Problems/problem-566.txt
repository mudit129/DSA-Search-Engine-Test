You are given a sequence of NN powers of an integer kk; let's denote the ii-th of these powers by kAikAi. You should partition this sequence into two non-empty contiguous subsequences; each element of the original sequence should appear in exactly one of these subsequences. In addition, the product of (the sum of elements of the left subsequence) and (the sum of elements of the right subsequence) should be maximum possible.
Find the smallest position at which you should split this sequence in such a way that this product is maximized.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and kk.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the size of the left subsequence. If there is more than one possible answer, print the smallest possible one.

Explanation
Example case 1: The actual sequence of powers is [21,21,23,23,25]=[2,2,8,8,32][21,21,23,23,25]=[2,2,8,8,32]. The maximum product is 20⋅32=64020⋅32=640. In the optimal solution, the sequence is partitioned into [2,2,8,8][2,2,8,8] and [32][32].
