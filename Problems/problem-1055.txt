A permutation of length NN is an array of NN integers (P1,P2,…,PN)(P1,P2,…,PN) where every integer from 11 to NN (inclusive) appears in it exactly once. The weight of a subsegment containing the elements (Pl,Pl+1,…,Pr)(Pl,Pl+1,…,Pr) is defined as follows:  W(l,r)=(r−l+1)⋅minl≤i≤r(Pi)W(l,r)=(r−l+1)⋅minl≤i≤r(Pi)
 where 1≤l≤r≤N1≤l≤r≤N and minl≤i≤r(Pi)minl≤i≤r(Pi) denotes the minimum element of the subsegment.
You are given two integers NN and XX. You need to determine if there exists a permutation of length NN such that it contains at least one subsegment having weight XX?
Input Format

The first line contains an integer TT - the number of test cases. The TT test cases then follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N,XN,X - the length of the permutation and the weight parameter mentioned in the question respectively.

Output Format
For each test case, print YES if there exists a permutation of length NN having at least one subsegment with a weight of XX, otherwise print NO.
You may print each character of Yes and No in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, YES will be considered identical).
Constraints

Explanation
Test case 11: [1,2,3][1,2,3] is one of the valid permutations because it contains the following subsegment having weight 22. 
W(1,2)=(2−1+1)⋅min1≤i≤2(Pi)=2⋅1=2W(1,2)=(2−1+1)⋅min1≤i≤2(Pi)=2⋅1=2 
Test case 22: It can be proven that there does not exist any permutation of length 33 which has a subsegment having weight 55.
Test case 33: [4,2,1,3,5][4,2,1,3,5] is one of the valid permutations because it contains the following subsegment having weight 66.
W(4,5)=(5−4+1)⋅min4≤i≤5(Pi)=2⋅3=6W(4,5)=(5−4+1)⋅min4≤i≤5(Pi)=2⋅3=6
