Let's suppose a thief enters in Chef's home at the party night  and he has CC capacity to take the items with him. In the Chef home, there are NN number of different items of W1,W2...WnW1,W2...Wn weights and can give profit of P1,P2...PnP1,P2...Pn respectively. Since the thief is very intelligent so he will make the maximum profit with less effort.
Since the Chef is busy in other arrangement and you are the Chef's best friend. So you have to find the total loss to file an FIR.
Note:Note: Breaking of the item is allowed and print the final output as Integer value after rounding-off the value.
Input:

First-line will contain TT, the number of test cases.  
Each test case contains three lines of input.   
First line contains, two integers N,CN,C.
Second line contains, W1,W2...WnW1,W2...Wn.
Third line contains, P1,P2...PnP1,P2...Pn.

Output:
For each test case, output in a single line loss of Chef.
Constraints

1≤T≤101≤T≤10
1≤N≤1031≤N≤103 
1≤C≤1041≤C≤104 
1≤W[i],P[i]≤1071≤W[i],P[i]≤107

Sample Input:
1
3 5
1 2 3
10 20 30
Sample Output:
50   
EXPLANATION:
Thief will take the items with weight 3,23,2 to make profit of  (30+20)=50(30+20)=50.
Hence Chef's loss will be 5050.
