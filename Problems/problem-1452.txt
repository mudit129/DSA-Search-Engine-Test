A (11-indexed) string SS of length NN is said to be anti-palindrome if, for each 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N, Si≠S(N+1−i)Si≠S(N+1−i).
You are given a string SS of length NN (consisting of lowercase Latin letters only). Rearrange the string to convert it into an anti-palindrome or determine that there is no rearrangement which is an anti-palindrome.
If there are multiple rearrangements of the string which are anti-palindromic, print any of them.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer TT — the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN — the length of the string SS.
The second line of each test case contains the string SS.

Output Format
For each test case, if it is possible to rearrange SS to convert it into an anti-palindrome, print YES in the first line and print the rearranged string in the second line. Otherwise, print NO.
You may print each character of YES and NO in uppercase or lowercase (for e.g. yes, yEs, Yes will be considered identical).
If there are multiple rearrangements of the string which are anti-palindromic, print any of them.
Constraints

1≤T≤1041≤T≤104
1≤N≤1051≤N≤105
SS contains only lowercase Latin letters
It is guaranteed that the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.

Explanation
Test case 11: No matter how the string is rearranged, the condition Si≠S(N+1−i)Si≠S(N+1−i) will not be satisfied for i=2i=2.
Test case 22: One possible rearrangement of the string which is anti-palindromic is abddcccc. Other answers, such as ccdaccdb, will also be accepted.
Test case 33: One possible rearrangement of the string which is anti-palindromic is xxyy.
Test case 44: It can be shown that none of the rearrangements of AA is anti-palindromic.
