Chef has two matrices AA and BB, each with size N×MN×M. Each cell of the matrix AA contains a character '0' or '1', while each cell of the matrix BB contains '?', '0' or '1'.
The matrix AA can be modified using zero or more operations. In one operation, Chef can choose two cells in the matrix AA which lie either in the same row or in the same column and flip the characters in each of these cells (flipping means changing '1' to '0' or '0' to '1').
Chef wants the matrix AA to match the matrix BB. Formally, for each row rr and column cc, if the cell in row rr and column cc of BB contains '0' or '1', then he wants the cell in row rr and column cc of AA to contain the same character; otherwise (for cells containing '?'), it may contain either '0' or '1'.
The difficulty of your task is described by a parameter EE. If E=0E=0, you should only find the smallest number of operations required to achieve this goal. If E=1E=1, you should also find one sequence of operations with the smallest length which achieves it.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, MM and EE.
NN lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains a single string AiAi with length MM describing the ii-th row of the matrix AA.
NN more lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains a single string BiBi with length MM describing the ii-th row of the matrix BB.

Output
For each test case:

If it is not possible to make AA match BB, print a single line containing the integer −1−1.
Otherwise, first, print a line containing a single integer KK ― the smallest required number of operations.
Then, if E=1E=1, print KK lines describing the sequence of operations you want to perform. An operation should be printed in one of the following formats:
R r i j to flip the characters in cells in row rr and columns ii and jj (1≤r≤N1≤r≤N, 1≤i,j≤M1≤i,j≤M)
C c i j to flip the characters in cells in column cc and rows ii and jj (1≤c≤M1≤c≤M, 1≤i,j≤N1≤i,j≤N)

If there are several possible answers, you may find any one of them.

Explanation
Example case 1: This is not the only solution ? a valid sequence of 33 row operations also exists.
Example case 2: We did not restore the sequence of operations because E=0E=0.
