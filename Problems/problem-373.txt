The median of a sequence is the element in the middle of the sequence after it is sorted. For a sequence with even size, the median is the average of the two middle elements of the sequence after sorting. For example, for a sequence A=[1,3,3,5,4,7,11]A=[1,3,3,5,4,7,11], the median is equal to 44, and for A=[2,3,4,5]A=[2,3,4,5], the median is equal to (3+4)/2=3.5(3+4)/2=3.5.
Fulu is a famous programmer in his country. He wrote the following program (given in pseudocode) for finding the median in a sequence AA with length NN:
read(N)
read(A[0], A[1], ..., A[N-1])
sort(A)
# simultaneously remove elements A[K] and A[N mod K] from the array A
# the order of the remaining N-2 elements is unchanged
remove(A[K], A[N mod K])
return A[(N-2)/2] # integer division

The program takes an integer KK as a parameter. Fulu can choose this integer arbitrarily between 11 and N−1N−1 inclusive.
Little Lima, Fulu's friend, thinks Fulu's program is wrong (as always). As finding one counterexample would be an easy task for Lima (he has already found the sequence A=[34,23,35,514]A=[34,23,35,514], which is a counterexample for any K≤3K≤3), Lima decided to make hacking more interesting. Fulu should give him four parameters S,K,m,MS,K,m,M (in addition to NN) and Lima should find the lexicographically smallest proper sequence AA with length NN as a counterexample.
We say that a sequence AA with length NN (00-indexed) is proper if it satisfies the following conditions:

it contains only positive integers
A0+A1+A2+⋯+AN−1=SA0+A1+A2+⋯+AN−1=S
m≤Ai≤Mm≤Ai≤M for each 0≤i<N0≤i<N
the number returned by Fulu's program, ran with the given parameter KK, is different from the correct median of the sequence AA

Can you help Lima find the lexicographically smallest counterexample or determine that Fulu's program works perfectly for the given parameters?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated integers NN, SS, KK, mm and MM.

Output
For each test case, if there is no proper sequence, print a single line containing the integer −1−1; otherwise, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers — the lexicographically smallest proper sequence.

Explanation
Example case 1: For the sequence A=[1,1,4]A=[1,1,4], it is already sorted, so the program would just remove the first two elements (K=1K=1, N%K=0N%K=0) and return the only remaining element 44. Obviously, the median of the original sequence is 11. It can be shown that there is no lexicographically smaller proper sequence.
Example case 2: The only possible sequence is A=[1,1,1,1]A=[1,1,1,1], which is not proper, since Fulu's program will give the correct answer 11 for it.
