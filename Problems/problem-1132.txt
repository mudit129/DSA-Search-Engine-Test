You are given a sequence aa and its first nn elements. 
The ii-th element of the sequence, where i>ni>n is generated by the following formula.
The ii-th element i>ni>n would be the floor of the mean of last nn elements of the sequence. Formally,
ai=⌊∑n−1k=0ai−n+kn⌋ai=⌊∑k=0n−1ai−n+kn⌋
For example, 
an+1=⌊a1+a2+..+ann⌋an+1=⌊a1+a2+..+ann⌋
an+2=⌊a2+a3+..+an+1n⌋an+2=⌊a2+a3+..+an+1n⌋
an+3=⌊a3+a4+..+an+2n⌋an+3=⌊a3+a4+..+an+2n⌋
You have to answer many queries in which you would be asked to tell some x-th element of the sequence, where xx would be provided in the query.
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
First line of each test case contains an integer nn.
The second of each test case contains nn space separated integers where ii-th of which denotes value of aiai.
The third line contains an integer QQ denoting the number of queries.
Each of the next QQ lines contains an integer xx, denoting that you should tell what's the xx-th element of sequence.

Output:
For each query, output an integer denoting the value of the corresponding element of the sequence.
