Chef loves to play with iron (Fe) and magnets (Ma). He took a row of NN cells (numbered 11 through NN) and placed some objects in some of these cells. You are given a string SS with length NN describing them; for each valid ii, the ii-th character of SS is one of the following:

'I' if the ii-th cell contains a piece of iron
'M' if the ii-th cell contains a magnet
'_' if the ii-th cell is empty
':' if the ii-th cell contains a conducting sheet
'X' if the ii-th cell is blocked

If there is a magnet in a cell ii and iron in a cell jj, the attraction power between these cells is Pi,j=K+1−|j−i|−Si,jPi,j=K+1−|j−i|−Si,j, where Si,jSi,j is the number of cells containing sheets between cells ii and jj. This magnet can only attract this iron if Pi,j>0Pi,j>0 and there are no blocked cells between the cells ii and jj.
Chef wants to choose some magnets (possibly none) and to each of these magnets, assign a piece of iron which this magnet should attract. Each piece of iron may only be attracted by at most one magnet and only if the attraction power between them is positive and there are no blocked cells between them. Find the maximum number of magnets Chef can choose.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.
The second line contains a single string SS with length NN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum number of magnets that can attract iron.
Constraints

1≤T≤2,0001≤T≤2,000
1≤N≤1051≤N≤105
0≤K≤1050≤K≤105
SS contains only characters 'I', 'M', '_', ':' and 'X'
the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅1065⋅106

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (30 points): there are no sheets, i.e. SS does not contain the character ':'
Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

Explanation
Example case 1: The attraction power between the only magnet and the only piece of iron is 5+1−3−2=15+1−3−2=1. Note that it decreases with distance and the number of sheets.
Example case 2:
The magnets in cells 11 and 33 can attract the piece of iron in cell 22, since the attraction power is 1010 in both cases. They cannot attract iron in cells 66 or 77 because there is a wall between them.
The magnet in cell 99 can attract the pieces of iron in cells 77 and 66; the attraction power is 88 and 77 respectively.
