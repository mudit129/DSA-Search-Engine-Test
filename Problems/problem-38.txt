Good's Train is a train which carry weights like grains, vegetables, and many other things in it.
You are given a task to add weights in each compartment of this good's train. Initially train compartments may or may not be empty, and you will be given qq task, in each task you will be provided with 3 data stated as below.

start number of compartment
end number of compartment
The weights, that needs to be onboarded in each compartment in the given range.

After you have completed all your qq tasks, you will need to give the total weights that is currently in this Good's Train.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT. TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases is as follows.
The next line of the input contains a single integer NN. NN denotes the total number of compartments in Good's Train(numbered from 11 to NN).
The next line of the input contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,A3...AnA1,A2,A3...An where ithith number denotes the initial weight of Good's that ithith compartment have.
The next line of the input contains a single integer qq. qq denotes the total number of tasks given to you.
Next qq lines contains, 3 space-separated integers S,E,WS,E,W denoting the start, end number of compartments(both inclusive) and WW denotes the weight to be onboarded in each compartment.

Output:

After completing all your qq tasks, print the total weights that is currently in this Good's Train.
