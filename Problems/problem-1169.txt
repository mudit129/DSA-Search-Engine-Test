He only can do the smaller length squares, but fails against the larger ones. Though he is a great magician, he is unable to solve this problem (he is not a programmer :p); he needs an expert to help him. As you are one of the best programmers in AUST, he asks you to solve the problem.
You will be given an integer  N (N will be odd length) , print the corresponding nested square to help Harry porter.
Input
First line there will an integer  T (1 ≤ T ≤ 20)  which represents number of test cases, next following T lines, there will an integer N (5 ≤ N ≤ 100) .
Output
For each test case print the case number and then print the image of the square. For drawing the lines use character  (‘#’) . See the sample I/O.
Example
Input:
2
5
