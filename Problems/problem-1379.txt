You are given an array AA of length NN, which initially is a permutation of integers from 11 to NN.
We want to make the array empty by performing the following operation NN times: choose any index ii and remove AiAi from AA, which decrements the size of AA by 11. 
We will perform exactly NN such operations. Apparently, there are N!N! ways to do this. But now we wonder how many ways satisfy that, during the process, the array doesn't contain any consecutive monotone triples? 
A consecutive monotone triple is a tuple of consecutive elements (i,i+1,i+2)(i,i+1,i+2)
which satisfy
Ai<Ai+1<Ai+2Ai<Ai+1<Ai+2 or Ai>Ai+1>Ai+2Ai>Ai+1>Ai+2.
Since the answer may be large, print it modulo 109+7109+7.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer TT −− the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains the single integer NN.
The second line of each testcases contains nn integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN −− the initial array AA.
Output Format
For each test case print a single integer −− the answer modulo 109+7109+7.

Explanation
In the second testcase, an example of a valid deletion is [1,4,2,3]→[1,4,3]→[1,3]→[1][1,4,2,3]→[1,4,3]→[1,3]→[1].
Meanwhile [1,4,2,3]→[1,2,3]→[1,3]→[1][1,4,2,3]→[1,2,3]→[1,3]→[1] is not a valid deletion since [1,2,3][1,2,3] contains a consectutive monoton triple.
