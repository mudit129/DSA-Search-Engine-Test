Initially, there is a magical stone of mass 2N2N lying at the origin of the number line. For the next NN seconds, the following event happens: 

Let us define the decomposition of a magical stone as follows: If there is a magical stone of mass M>1M>1 lying at coordinate X, then it decomposes into two magical stones, each of mass M2 lying at the coordinates X−1 and X+1 respectively. The original stone of mass M gets destroyed in the process. 
Each second, all the magical stones undergo decomposition simultaneously.

Note that there can be more than one stone at any coordinate X. 
Given a range [L,R], find out the number of stones present at each of the coordinates in the range [L,R]. As the number of stones can be very large, output them modulo (109+7). 
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains three integers N, L and R, as described in the problem statement. 

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line a total of (R−L+1) space-separated integers. The ith integer will denote the number of stones present at X=(L+i−1) coordinate.
As the number of stones can be very large, output them modulo (109+7). 
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N≤106
−N≤L≤R≤N
Sum of (R−L+1) over all the test cases doesn't exceed 105.

Explanation
Test case 1: Let us look at the number of stones for x=−2 to x=2 as the time progresses:
t=0: {0,0,1,0,0}
t=1: {0,1,0,1,0}
t=2: {1,0,2,0,1}
We have to output the number of stones at x=−2 to x=2, which is {1,0,2,0,1}.
Test case 2: Similar to first test case, We have to output the number of stones at x=0 to x=2, which is {2,0,1}.
