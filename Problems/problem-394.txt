Robert is a maths teacher and he made a question for his students.
Question is a matrix of NN X NN with all distinct elements from  11 to N∗NN∗N. One has to apply maxpool function of filter matrix 22 X 22 to get the answer, that is for each 22 X 22 matrix you have to write the maximum element in corresponding matrix of size (N−1)(N−1) X (N−1)(N−1).
for example
if NN = 33 and matrix given is
1 7 4
2 3 5
9 8 6

 
then after applying maxpool function we get:
7 7
9 8

Robert is a careless person and forgot the actual question or NN X NN matrix but he knows the answer or (N−1)(N−1) X (N−1)(N−1) matrix.
Can you help him to derive any valid question matrix(must contain all the numbers from 11 to NN * NN ) back from the answer given?
Inputs are given in such a way that the answer always exists. In case of multiple answers print any.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN:- The size of the question matrix or matrix before the filter is applied.
Next (N−1)(N−1) lines contains (N−1)(N−1) space-seperated integers in each line.

Output

For each test case, print the matrix of size NN X NN . Print NN lines where each line will contain NN integers separated by a space.

Constraints
