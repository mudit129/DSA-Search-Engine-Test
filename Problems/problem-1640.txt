Yukti found a strange paper with a Boolean expression written on it. Unfortunately, all the operands were missing from this expression. Being an innovative person, Yukti immediately created a riddle for her students based on this incomplete expression.
The students are given a string LL describing a valid Boolean expression, where each operand (value) is replaced by the character '#'. A valid expression is defined as one of the following:

A single term '#'.
A string in the format "([expression1][operator][expression2])", where [expression1] and [expression2] are valid expressions and [operator] is one of the characters '&', '|' and '^' (denoting bitwise AND, OR and XOR respectively).

Each of the characters '#' in the string LL should be replaced by one of the characters '0', '1', 'a' and 'A', uniformly randomly and independently. Then, the resulting expression is evaluated as follows:

A Boolean value aa (00 or 11) is chosen. Each occurrence of the character 'a' is interpreted as this value and each occurrence of 'A' is interpreted as its negation (1−a1−a). The characters '0' and '1' are interpreted as the Boolean values 00 and 11 respectively.
Since there are two possible values of aa, we obtain two constant Boolean expressions this way. Let's denote them by G0G0 (when aa = 0) and G1G1 (when aa = 1). 
Let's evaluate G0G0 and G1G1.
If G0=G1=0G0=G1=0, the value of the expression is '0'.
If G0=G1=1G0=G1=1, the value of the expression is '1'.
If G0=0G0=0 and G1=1G1=1, the value of the expression is 'a'.
If G0=1G0=1 and G1=0G1=0, the value of the expression is 'A'.

Can you find the probabilities with which the expression obtained after substituting for each character '#' evaluates to these values? It can be proved that for each of these values, the probability can be expressed as a fraction PQPQ, where PP and QQ are integers (P≥0P≥0, Q>0Q>0) and QQ is coprime with 998,244,353998,244,353. You should compute P⋅Q−1P⋅Q−1 modulo 998,244,353998,244,353 for each of these values.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single string LL.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing four space-separated integers ― the answers corresponding to the probabilities that the value of the Boolean expression is '0', '1', 'a' or 'A' respectively.

Explanation
Example case 1: The probabilities that the value of the expression is '0', '1', 'a' or 'A' are all equal to 1/41/4.
Example case 2: There can be total 16 different expressions. Out of which :
For : (1&1)  ---> G0=G1=1G0=G1=1, Probability for 1 = 1/161/16 
(a&1) , (1&a) , (a&a) ---> G0=0G0=0 and G1=1G1=1, Probability for 'a' = 3/163/16 
(A&1) , (1&A) , (A&A) ----> G0=1G0=1 and G1=0G1=0, Probability for 'A' = 3/163/16
Rest all expressions have G0=G1=0G0=G1=0, Probability for '0' = 9/169/16 
Probability are expressed as mentioned in Problem Statement.
