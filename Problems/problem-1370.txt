Rick is bored again. This time he decides to try out competitive programming. When he came across the travelling salesman problem, he instantly coded the algorithm and decided to test it out right away. For this, he used his number generator gun to generate NN numbers on the X-axis, and stores them in an array DD. To obtain some information about the numbers, he asks QQ queries on the X-axis.
The QQ queries are described as ′L′L RR XX Y′Y′, where L,RL,R denote the endpoints of the range of query (both inclusive), and XX and YY are query parameters. For a particular query, for all points on the X-axis that lie between LL and RR both inclusive, if their value is VV before the query, it changes to X∗V+YX∗V+Y after the query.
After running all queries, Rick wants to store values at all points belonging to the array DD. Help him obtain those so that he can write the optimal solution for the traveling salesman problem.
Input:

First line of the input contains two spaced positive integers NN and QQ denoting the number of elements in the array D and number of queries respectively.
The next line contains NN non-negative integers denoting the points on the coordinate axis for which you require the information.
Next, QQ  lines follow, where each line contains a query of type LL RR XX YY where LL RR  denote the range of the query while XX and YY  are the parameters of the query

Output:
Print the values % (109+7)(109+7) at each of the points belonging to DD in a single line where ithith no. corresponds to the value of point D[i]D[i] on the X-axis.

1≤D[i]≤10151≤D[i]≤1015
0≤L≤R≤10150≤L≤R≤1015

Sample Input:
3 2
4 5 8
3 7 3 2
0 8 2 5
Sample Output:
9 9 5

EXPLANATION:
when the first query is applied on range 3 to 7, all the point's value changes according to the equation 3x+2, as initially, all no.s are zero, the value of no.s from 3 to 7 becomes 2.
When the 2nd query is applied to the range 0 to 8, value at point 4 which is initially 2 changes acc to the equation 2x+5, and hence becomes 9. Similarly, value at point 5 becomes 9  and value at point 8 which was 0 before this query, after this query it becomes 5. Hence the Final answer is 9 9 5.
