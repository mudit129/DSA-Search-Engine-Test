You are given KK permutations of integers 11 through NN. For each ii (1≤i≤K1≤i≤K), the ii-th permutation is denoted by Ai,1,Ai,2,…,Ai,NAi,1,Ai,2,…,Ai,N.
Construct a directed acyclic graph with NN nodes (numbered 11 through NN) such that:

Each of the given permutations is a valid topological sort of the graph. Formally, for each valid kk and each i,ji,j (1≤i<j≤N1≤i<j≤N), there is no edge from the node Ak,jAk,j to the node Ak,iAk,i.
The outdegree of each node is at most 11.
The number of nodes with indegree 00 is the smallest possible.

If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.
KK lines follow. For each ii (1≤i≤K1≤i≤K), the ii-th of these lines contains NN space-separated integers Ai,1,Ai,2,…,Ai,NAi,1,Ai,2,…,Ai,N.

Output
For each test case, print two lines.

The first of these lines should contain one integer ― the minimum number of nodes with indegree 00.
The second line should contain NN space-separated integers v1,v2,…,vNv1,v2,…,vN describing your graph in the following way: for each valid ii, if vi=0vi=0, there is no outgoing edge from the ii-th node; otherwise, there is an edge from the ii-th node to the vivi-th node.

Explanation
Example case 1: The graph must consist of just two disconnected nodes, since no edges are allowed. Hence, there are two nodes with indegree 00.
Example case 2: The graph may contain an edge from node 11 to node 22. Then, there is only one node with indegree 00.
