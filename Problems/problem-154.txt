Oh, these difficult contests… In each contest, there are so many hard tasks Chef cannot solve. However, he knows that he can only become a successful coder if he works hard. Fortunately, he has a problem in mind for training.
You are given two positive integers aa and bb. You may apply the following magical operation any number of times (including zero):

choose an arbitrary positive integer dd
perform exactly one of the following actions:
add dd to aa, add d−1d−1 to bb
add d−1d−1 to aa, add dd to bb

Chef is asking you to find out if it is possible to obtain a=ba=b. Help him!
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers aa and bb. 

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to obtain a=ba=b or "NO" if it is impossible.

YES
Explanation
Example case 1: One possible strategy for Chef is:

choose d=10d=10, add d−1=9d−1=9 to aa and d=10d=10 to bb; after this operation, a=14a=14 and b=17b=17
choose d=10d=10, add d=10d=10 to aa and d−1=9d−1=9 to bb; afterwards, a=24a=24 and b=26b=26
choose d=9d=9, add d=9d=9 to aa and d−1=8d−1=8 to bb; afterwards, a=33a=33 and b=34b=34
choose d=9d=9, add dd to aa and d−1d−1 to bb; finally, we have a=b=42a=b=42
